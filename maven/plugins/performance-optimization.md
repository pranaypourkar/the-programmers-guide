# Performance Optimization

## **About**

The **Performance Optimization** category in Maven includes plugins that focus on:

* Reducing **build time**
* Improving **build efficiency**
* Minimizing **redundant computation**
* Managing **resource usage**
* Leveraging **parallelism** and **incremental builds**

These plugins are especially useful in large projects, CI/CD pipelines, or multi-module builds where performance bottlenecks can lead to wasted time and compute resources.

#### **Why Optimize Maven Performance?**

* **Faster feedback loops** during development
* **Reduced CI/CD pipeline durations**
* **Scalability** with large codebases or teams
* Avoid **rebuilding unchanged modules**
* Efficient **use of CPU/memory resources**

## **build-cache-extension**

A newer concept (inspired by Gradle), the **Maven Build Cache Extension** avoids re-execution of goals if the inputs haven't changed.

> Still evolving but powerful when integrated with remote cache solutions.

**Setup**

```bash
mvn -Dmaven.build.cache.enabled=true clean install
```

**Use Cases**

* Speeds up repeated builds
* Share cache across developers or CI environments

## **takari-lifecycle-plugin**

From Takari (by the creators of Maven), this plugin offers improved incremental build behavior over default Maven.

> Not part of core Maven but a major attempt to modernize build performance.

#### **Features**

* **Incremental build** awareness
* File-level change detection
* Parallel-safe plugin execution

## **maven-parallel-plugin**

Enables **parallel execution of Maven goals** across modules or lifecycle phases to speed up the build process.

**Syntax Example**

```bash
mvn -T 4 clean install
```

> `-T 4` = Use 4 threads for parallel execution

#### **Options**

* `-T 1C` (one thread per CPU core)
* `-T 2.0C` (2 threads per core)

#### **Best For**

* Multi-module projects
* Heavy builds

## **maven-dependency-plugin**

While primarily a dependency-related plugin, it helps optimize performance by removing **unnecessary or conflicting dependencies** that increase classpath resolution time.

**Helpful Goals**

* `analyze`: Detects unused and undeclared dependencies
* `analyze-duplicate`: Detects duplicate dependencies

## **maven-antrun-plugin**

Executes custom tasks to pre-process or post-process during builds. While not directly for performance, it can be used to **reduce work** done in later phases (e.g., cleaning temporary files or skipping steps conditionally).

## **incremental-build-plugin**

Used to identify and build only **changed modules** in a multi-module Maven build.

> Not part of Apache Maven but available in open source tools (like Netflix Nebula, Spotify, etc.)

## **maven-clean-plugin**

While often used for cleanup, it can be optimized to **avoid unnecessary deletes** of unchanged outputs, especially in custom workflows or large builds.
