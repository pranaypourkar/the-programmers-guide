# Customization and Enhancement

## About

The **Customization and Enhancement** category includes plugins that extend Mavenâ€™s default behavior. These plugins empower developers to tailor the build process by adding non-standard actions, injecting additional metadata, modifying generated artifacts, managing directories, or defining custom lifecycles.

These are especially useful when our project needs to:

* Add metadata or manipulate build structure
* Create source directories dynamically
* Modify classpaths or attach artifacts
* Perform advanced scripting or logic injection
