# Personal Projects

## About

This section showcases a curated list of my personal projects—designed, developed, and maintained outside of professional work. Each project highlights specific technical skills, problem-solving capabilities, and my passion for building practical solutions. These projects serve as tangible evidence of my learning, initiative, and ability to deliver real-world applications. You'll find architecture overviews, key features, tech stacks used, challenges faced, and how each project has contributed to my growth as a developer.

Whether it’s exploring new frameworks, implementing best practices, or solving everyday problems through code, these projects reflect my hands-on approach to continuous improvement and innovation.
