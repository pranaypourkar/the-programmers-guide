# Anti-Patterns

## About

An **anti-pattern** is a common but counterproductive solution to a recurring problem in software development. Unlike code smells, which signal deeper issues, anti-patterns reflect **design or architectural decisions** that seem correct initially but lead to poor outcomes over time.

> In short: _An anti-pattern is the wrong solution to a real problem._

They often arise from inexperience, rushed timelines, or misuse of language features and design principles. Recognizing anti-patterns is the first step toward writing maintainable, scalable, and clean code.

## Why Anti-Patterns Matter ?

* **Maintainability Issues**: Anti-patterns increase complexity and decrease code readability.
* **Scalability Barriers**: They introduce tight coupling, redundancy, and poor modularity.
* **Team Friction**: Developers working on codebases with anti-patterns often struggle to understand or safely modify code.
* **Hidden Technical Debt**: They accumulate into fragile systems that are costly to fix.

Understanding anti-patterns equips developers to avoid design pitfalls and make informed architectural decisions.
