# ArchUnit

## **About**

**ArchUnit** is a popular Java library designed to help developers enforce architectural constraints in their codebase. It allows teams to validate architecture rules and prevent the introduction of unwanted dependencies or code patterns. This is especially useful for maintaining consistency, reducing technical debt, and ensuring the system adheres to predefined architectural principles.

Refer to the official documentation for more details - [https://github.com/TNG/ArchUnit/tree/main](https://github.com/TNG/ArchUnit/tree/main)

## **Features of ArchUnit**

ArchUnit is a **powerful Java testing library** that allows us to enforce architectural rules programmatically. Its main features include:

1. **Architecture Rules as Tests**
   * Define architectural constraints using **unit-test style syntax**.
   * Example rules:
     * “Controllers should not access repositories directly.”
     * “No cyclic dependencies between packages.”
2. **Layered Architecture Enforcement**
   * Supports **layered architecture testing** (Controller → Service → Repository).
   * Prevents accidental dependency violations across layers.
   *   Example:

       ```java
       layeredArchitecture()
           .layer("Controller").definedBy("..controller..")
           .layer("Service").definedBy("..service..")
           .layer("Repository").definedBy("..repository..")
           .whereLayer("Controller").mayNotBeAccessedByAnyLayer()
           .whereLayer("Repository").mayOnlyBeAccessedByLayers("Service");
       ```
3. **Customizable Rules**
   * Write our **own rules** for naming conventions, package usage, annotations, or class design.
   * Example: “Classes ending with `Impl` must reside in `impl` package.”
4. **Integration with JUnit**
   * Works seamlessly with **JUnit 5 and 4**.
   * Use `@ArchTest` and `@AnalyzeClasses` to run rules as part of your **test suite**.
5. **Annotation and Package-Based Checks**
   * Enforce constraints based on **annotations**, **class names**, or **package structures**.
   * Example: `@Service` classes must not depend on `@Controller`.
6. **Readable Failure Messages**
   * ArchUnit provides **human-readable error messages** when a rule is violated.
   * Makes it easy to understand **why a test failed** and how to fix it.
7. **Independence from Frameworks**
   * Works with **any Java project**, not limited to Spring.
   * Can be applied to **Spring Boot, Jakarta EE, Micronaut, Quarkus**, or plain Java projects.
8. **Encourages Maintainable Architecture**
   * Helps **prevent architectural erosion** over time.
   * Ensures **layer separation**, **package isolation**, and **consistent design patterns**.

## **Maven Dependency**

**Add the Dependency**: Include ArchUnit in `pom.xml`

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.tngtech.archunit</groupId>
    <artifactId>archunit</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.tngtech.archunit</groupId>
    <artifactId>archunit-junit5</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

## Limitations

While ArchUnit is a powerful tool for enforcing architectural rules, it does have some limitations:

1. **Static Analysis Only**
   * ArchUnit analyzes **class files and bytecode**, not runtime behavior.
   * Cannot detect **dynamic behavior**, reflection-based dependencies, or runtime-generated classes.
2. **Requires Maintenance of Rules**
   * Architectural rules must be **kept up to date** as our project evolves.
   * Overly strict rules may **break frequently** during refactoring, requiring updates.
3. **Limited to Java Projects**
   * Works only with **Java bytecode**.
   * Cannot enforce rules in non-Java modules (e.g., Kotlin or Scala mixed projects may need extra care).
4. **Performance Overhead in Large Projects**
   * Analyzing **large codebases** with many rules may increase test execution time.
   * Needs careful selection of packages/classes to analyze to avoid slow test runs.
5. **Cannot Detect Semantic Design Issues**
   * ArchUnit enforces **structural rules** (class, package, dependency).
   * Cannot judge **code quality, design patterns, or runtime correctness**.
6. **Learning Curve for Complex Rules**
   * Writing **advanced, customized rules** requires understanding ArchUnit’s API and fluent syntax.
   * Developers need some time to master `ArchRuleDefinition`, `classes()`, and layered architecture checks.
