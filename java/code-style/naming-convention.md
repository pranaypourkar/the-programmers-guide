# Naming Convention

## Variable names

* Variable names must begin with a letter (a-z or A-Z), an underscore (\_), or a currency character ($ or â‚¬).
* First character of a variable name cannot be a digit. It can start with currency or underscore also.
* Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning `myVariable` and `MyVariable` are considered different variables.
* Variable names cannot be a Java keyword or reserved word, such as `int`, `class`, `public`, etc
