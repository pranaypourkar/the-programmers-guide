# Imports

## About

The **import statement** in Java allows one class to use classes and interfaces defined in other packages. While the functionality is straightforward, how imports are structured and managed greatly impacts **readability**, **maintainability**, and **consistency** in large codebases.

Even though IDEs can manage imports automatically, **establishing import conventions** ensures uniformity across developers and reduces unnecessary clutter, merge conflicts, and cognitive overhead during code reviews.

## Importance of Import Style

* **Improves Clarity:** Organized imports reflect dependencies clearly.
* **Reduces Noise:** Removes unused or redundant imports.
* **Prevents Wildcards:** Avoids namespace ambiguity caused by wildcard imports (`*`).
* **Maintains Consistency:** Team-wide formatting helps enforce clean imports.
* **Optimizes Version Control:** Prevents unnecessary diff churn from reordering or adding unrelated imports.

## General Import Best Practices

### 1. **Avoid Wildcard Imports**

Avoid using wildcard (`*`) imports like:

```java
import java.util.*;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.*;
```

**Why avoid:**

* Can lead to namespace clashes.
* Obscures what classes are actually used.
* Makes code less readable.
* Affects static analysis tools and IDE suggestions.

**Preferred:**

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
```

Use specific imports even if importing multiple classes from the same package.

### 2. **Remove Unused Imports**

Remove imports that are not used in the class.

**Why:**

* Reduces noise and distraction.
* Prevents misleading assumptions about dependencies.
* Keeps diffs clean in version control.

Most IDEs (e.g., IntelliJ or Eclipse) have a shortcut for this (e.g., `Ctrl + Alt + O` in IntelliJ).

### 3. **Group Imports Logically**

Organize import statements into logical groups with blank lines between them:

1. **Java standard libraries** (`java.`, `javax.`)
2. **Third-party libraries** (e.g., `org.springframework`, `com.fasterxml.jackson`)
3. **Project-specific imports** (e.g., `com.mycompany`)

**Example:**

```java
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.util.List;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

import com.mycompany.project.domain.User;
import com.mycompany.project.util.DateUtils;
```

This grouping helps quickly identify the origin of each dependency.
