# Number System

## About

Number systems are methods for representing numbers in a consistent manner. They are essential for various fields, including mathematics, computer science, and engineering. There are 4 commonly used system i.e. Decimal, Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal.

## Decimal Number System (Base 10)

### **Overview:**

* The most common number system used in daily life.
* Base 10 system, which means it has 10 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
* Each digit's position in a number has a value that is a power of 10.

### **Example:**

* The number 345 in decimal can be expressed as:&#x20;

### **Usage:**

* Used universally in everyday arithmetic and counting.

## Binary Number System (Base 2)

### **Overview:**

* Used primarily in computing and digital electronics.
* Base 2 system, with only two digits: 0 and 1.
* Each digit's position in a number has a value that is a power of 2.

### **Example:**

* The binary number 1011 can be expressed as

### **Usage:**

* Binary code is the fundamental language of computers.
* Used in digital circuits and data representation in computers.

## Octal Number System (Base 8)

### **Overview:**

* Base 8 system, with eight digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
* Each digit's position in a number has a value that is a power of 8.
* Group by 3 bits i.e. (2^3 = 8) in a binary number.

### **Example:**

* The octal number 345 can be expressed as:

### **Usage:**

* Sometimes used in computing as a more compact representation of binary-coded values.
* Historically significant in early computing systems.

## Hexadecimal Number System (Base 16)

### **Overview:**

* Base 16 system, with sixteen digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F.
* Each digit's position in a number has a value that is a power of 16.
* Group by 4 bits i.e. (2^4 = 16) in a binary number.

### **Example:**

* The hexadecimal number 1A3 can be expressed as:

### **Usage:**

* Widely used in computer science and programming.
* Handy for representing large binary values compactly, such as memory addresses and color codes in web design.
