# ExecutorService Implementations

## About&#x20;

Java's `ExecutorService` provides a framework for managing a pool of threads to execute asynchronous tasks. The framework abstracts the creation, execution, and management of threads, making it easier to work with concurrent tasks. Various implementations of `ExecutorService` cater to different use cases and requirements. Below are some of the main `ExecutorService` implementations in Java.

## 1. **ThreadPoolExecutor**

`ThreadPoolExecutor` is the commonly used and configurable implementation of `ExecutorService`. It allows for fine-grained control over thread management and task handling.

### **Key Characteristics**

* **Core Pool Size**: The minimum number of threads that are always kept alive, even if they are idle.
* **Maximum Pool Size**: The maximum number of threads allowed in the pool.
* **Keep-Alive Time**: The maximum time that excess idle threads will wait for new tasks before terminating.
* **Work Queue**: The queue used for holding tasks before they are executed. Can be `ArrayBlockingQueue`, `LinkedBlockingQueue`, `SynchronousQueue`, etc.
* **Rejected Execution Handler**: Defines the policy for handling tasks that cannot be executed (e.g., due to a full queue or pool shutdown). Options include `AbortPolicy`, `CallerRunsPolicy`, `DiscardPolicy`, and `DiscardOldestPolicy`.

### **Example**

```java
ExecutorService executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
    10, // core pool size
    20, // maximum pool size
    60L, // keep-alive time
    TimeUnit.SECONDS, // time unit
    new LinkedBlockingQueue<Runnable>(), // work queue
    new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy() // rejection policy
);
```
