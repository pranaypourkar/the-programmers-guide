# Streams

About

Java Streams, introduced in Java 8, revolutionized how developers process collections and sequences of data. They provide a modern, functional approach to handling data manipulation tasks, making code more concise, readable, and expressive.

What Are Streams?

Java **Streams API** is a powerful abstraction introduced in **Java 8** that allows functional-style operations on **collections, arrays, or I/O resources**. It enables **declarative** and **parallel** processing of data, making it easier to work with large datasets efficiently.

A **Stream** is a **sequence of elements** that supports various operations such as filtering, mapping, and reducing, without modifying the original data source.
