# Inheritance vs. Composition

## About

In object-oriented programming, **Inheritance** and **Composition** are two fundamental techniques used to achieve **code reuse** and build relationships between classes. Though they aim for similar goals, they approach the problem differently and each has its own advantages and trade-offs.

## **What is Inheritance ?**

**Inheritance** is a mechanism where a class (subclass or child) derives from another class (superclass or parent), inheriting its fields and methods.

* Defines an "**is-a**" relationship.
* Promotes code reuse by allowing subclasses to inherit behaviour.
* Supports method overriding for polymorphism.

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}
```

**Usage**

```java
Dog d = new Dog();
d.eat();   // inherited from Animal
d.bark();  // defined in Dog
```

## **What is Composition?**

**Composition** is a design technique in which a class is composed of one or more objects of other classes, allowing you to build complex types by combining simpler ones.

* Defines a "**has-a**" relationship.
* Offers greater flexibility and modularity.
* Behavior is achieved by delegating tasks to internal objects.

```java
class Engine {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine starts");
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine = new Engine();

    void startCar() {
        engine.start();  // delegation
        System.out.println("Car is running");
    }
}
```

**Usage**

```java
Car car = new Car();
car.startCar();
```

## **When to Use Inheritance & Composition ?**

Use inheritance when:

* The subclass is a **specialized version** of the superclass.
* There is a clear **is-a** relationship.
* We want to leverage **polymorphism** for method overriding.
* The base class provides **stable and reusable behavior**.

Use composition when:

* We need **flexibility** and **maintainability**.
* We want to change behavior at **runtime**.
* We want to **reuse functionality** without forming a strict hierarchy.
* We want to avoid the problems of deep inheritance trees.
