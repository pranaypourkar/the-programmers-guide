## About

The Packages section provides an overview of the different categories of libraries and packages commonly used in Java development. It helps you understand the distinctions between core Java libraries, official specifications, third-party libraries, and our own custom code. This organization aids in efficiently navigating and understanding the various components of your Java application, from the built-in Java SE functionality to external libraries and frameworks.
