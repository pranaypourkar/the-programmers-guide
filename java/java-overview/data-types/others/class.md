# Class

#### **About**

The `Class` class in Java, part of the `java.lang` package, represents the metadata of a Java class or interface at runtime. It is the entry point to Java's Reflection API, allowing developers to inspect, analyze, and manipulate the structure of classes, fields, methods, constructors, and annotations dynamically.

Every object in Java has a corresponding `Class` object that can be obtained at runtime. This enables introspection and dynamic behavior.
