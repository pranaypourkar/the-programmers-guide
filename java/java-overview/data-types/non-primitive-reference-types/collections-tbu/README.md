# Collections - TBU

## About

Collections in Java are part of the **Java Collections Framework (JCF)**, a set of classes and interfaces designed to handle and manipulate groups of objects effectively. They provide data structures like lists, sets, and maps, along with algorithms to operate on these data structures, such as searching, sorting, and iterating. The Java Collections Framework is a vital tool for any Java developer, offering flexibility, scalability, and efficiency in managing large amounts of data.
