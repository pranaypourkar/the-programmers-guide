# Thread Resource Sharing

## About

Threads within a process share the same memory space, which provides both advantages and challenges. Understanding what resources threads share and what remains unique to each thread is crucial for writing efficient, thread-safe applications.

## **Shared Resources in Threads**

Threads within the same process share the following resources:

### **1. Heap Memory**

* All threads can access objects allocated in the heap.
* Shared objects can be modified by multiple threads, leading to potential data inconsistency.

### **2. Static Variables**

* Static variables belong to the class and are shared across all threads in the process.
* Improper access without synchronization can lead to race conditions.

### **3. Open File Descriptors**

* If a thread opens a file, other threads in the same process can read/write to it.
* Concurrent access needs to be handled properly to avoid data corruption.

### **4. Network Sockets**

* Multiple threads can send/receive data on the same socket.
* Proper coordination (e.g., using thread-safe buffers) is required to prevent data loss or corruption.

### **5. Class Metadata & Loaded Classes**

* The Java class loader loads classes into the shared method area.
* All threads can access class methods and static blocks.

## **Thread-Specific Resources (Not Shared)**

Each thread has its own separate copy of the following resources:

### **1. Stack Memory**

* Each thread has its own stack that stores method call information, local variables, and return addresses.
* This prevents conflicts in method execution.

### **2. Program Counter (PC) Register**

* Tracks the next instruction to execute for each thread.
* Ensures independent execution of thread instructions.

### **3. Thread-Specific Storage (ThreadLocal)**

* Allows threads to maintain independent copies of variables.
* Useful for maintaining state information specific to each thread.

### **4. Registers & Execution Context**

* CPU registers (such as instruction pointers) are not shared between threads.
* Each thread has its own execution state and register set.
