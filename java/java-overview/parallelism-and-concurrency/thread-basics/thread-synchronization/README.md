# Thread Synchronization

## About

Thread synchronization is a mechanism that ensures that multiple threads can work together without causing inconsistencies in shared resources. When multiple threads access shared data concurrently, it can lead to race conditions, inconsistent data, and unpredictable behavior. Synchronization helps control access to shared resources, ensuring data integrity and correctness.
