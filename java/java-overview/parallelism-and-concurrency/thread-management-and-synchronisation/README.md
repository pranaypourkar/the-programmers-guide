# Thread Management & Synchronisation

## About

Thread management and synchronization are fundamental concepts in **multithreading** that ensure efficient execution, resource sharing, and safe communication between threads. Proper thread coordination helps in **preventing race conditions, deadlocks, starvation, and performance issues** while maximizing system efficiency.

This section covers key aspects of thread management and synchronization, including resource sharing, locking mechanisms, and best practices to maintain thread safety in concurrent programming.
