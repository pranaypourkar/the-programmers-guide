# OOP Principles

## About

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes.&#x20;

## Java follows four key OOP principles

### **1. Encapsulation** ðŸ”’

* Encapsulation is the practice of **hiding internal details** of a class and exposing only necessary functionality.
* Achieved using **private fields** and **public methods (getters/setters)**.
* Ensures **data integrity** and prevents **direct modification** of variables.

### **2. Inheritance** ðŸ”„

* Inheritance allows a class (**child/subclass**) to acquire properties and behaviors from another class (**parent/superclass**).
* Promotes **code reusability** and **hierarchical relationships**.
* Java uses the `extends` keyword to implement inheritance.

### **3. Polymorphism** ðŸŽ­

* Polymorphism allows objects to take **multiple forms**, enabling flexibility and dynamic behavior.
* Two types:
  * **Method Overloading** (Compile-time polymorphism) â€“ Same method name, different parameters.
  * **Method Overriding** (Runtime polymorphism) â€“ Child class provides a specific implementation of a parent class method.

### **4. Abstraction** ðŸŽ¨

* Abstraction simplifies complex systems by showing only **essential features** and hiding unnecessary details.
* Achieved using **abstract classes** (`abstract` keyword) and **interfaces**.
* Improves **modularity** and reduces **code complexity**.

## **Importance of OOP Concepts**

OOP is crucial in software development because it:

* **Enhances Code Reusability** â€“ Inheritance enables sharing of code, reducing duplication.
* **Improves Maintainability** â€“ Encapsulation helps in keeping code modular and well-organized.
* **Supports Scalability** â€“ OOP makes it easier to expand applications without breaking existing code.
* **Encourages Code Reusability** â€“ Objects and classes allow efficient code sharing across projects.
* **Enhances Security** â€“ Data hiding through encapsulation prevents unauthorized modifications.

#### **Common misconception about OOP is that it is only for large projects**&#x20;

Even small projects benefit from code organization and reusability.
