# Method Overriding & Overloading

## **What is meant by Method Overriding?**

Method overriding happens if the sub-class method satisfies the below conditions with the Super-class method:

* Method name should be the same
* The argument should be the same
* Return type should also be the same

The key benefit of overriding is that the Sub-class can provide some specific information about that sub-class type than the super-class.

## **What is meant by Overloading?**

Method overloading happens for different classes or within the same class.

For method overloading, sub-class method should satisfy the below conditions with the Super-class method (or) methods in the same class itself:

* Same method name
* Different argument types
* There may be different return types
