# OOP Basics

## **About**

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm that organises code into **objects**, making it modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. Java is an **object-oriented language**, meaning everything revolves around objects and classes.

## **Key Concepts**

1. **Object** – An instance of a class that contains state (fields/attributes) and behavior (methods).
2. **Class** – A blueprint for creating objects; defines attributes and methods.
3. **Methods & Fields** – Fields store object data, and methods define behavior.
4. **Constructors** – Special methods used to initialize objects.
5. **Access Modifiers** – Control visibility of fields and methods (e.g., `private`, `public`).

OOP helps in **code reusability**, **modularity**, and **scalability**. More details on each concept are covered in the subpages.
