# Java Internals

## About

The **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** is the execution engine that runs Java applications. It abstracts system details and provides features like memory management, security, and performance optimizations. This section explores its core components and internal workings.

## **1. JVM Overview**

* Key components of JVM and their roles.
* How Java code is converted into bytecode and executed.

## **2. Memory Management**

* How JVM allocates and manages memory (Heap, Stack, Metaspace).
* Garbage Collection mechanisms and optimizations.

## **3. Class Loading Mechanism**

* How classes are loaded, verified, and initialized.
* Role of ClassLoaders and dynamic loading.

## **4. Execution Engine**

* How JVM interprets and compiles bytecode.
* Role of JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler for performance improvements.

## **5. JVM Runtime Internals**

* **Variables & Data Handling:** How JVM stores and processes variables.
* **Exception Handling:** Internal working of exception processing and stack unwinding.
* **Threading & Synchronization:** How JVM manages threads, locks, and concurrency.

## **6. Java Security**

* JVM's built-in security mechanisms like ClassLoader security and cryptography.
