# Asynchronous Computation

Asynchronous computation refers to the execution of tasks or operations independently of the main program flow. In synchronous programming, tasks are executed one after the other, and the program waits for each task to complete before moving on to the next one. However, in asynchronous programming, tasks can be executed concurrently, and the program does not wait for each task to finish before proceeding.
