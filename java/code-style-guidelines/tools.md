# Tools

## About

In any collaborative software project, manually enforcing code style rules is inefficient and error-prone. **Code style tools** help automate the process of verifying, formatting, and maintaining consistent code formatting, naming, layout, and structure across a team or organization.

These tools **reduce friction during code reviews**, **prevent unnecessary formatting issues**, and **ensure a consistent codebase** that’s easier to maintain and evolve.

## Importance of Code Style Tools

* **Enforces Team Standards Automatically:** Ensures every developer adheres to the same rules.
* **Reduces Manual Review Effort:** Avoids nitpicking during pull requests.
* **Improves Developer Productivity:** Auto-formatting reduces cognitive load and formatting discussions.
* **Supports Continuous Integration:** Helps fail builds when style rules are violated.
* **Increases Readability and Predictability:** Makes it easy for developers to read and understand any file in the codebase.

## Common Code Style Tools in Java

### 1. **Checkstyle**

**Purpose:** Analyzes Java code to ensure it adheres to a specified coding standard.

**Key Features:**

* Enforces naming conventions, class structure, import order, and formatting rules.
* Integrates with IDEs (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse), CI pipelines, and Maven/Gradle.
* Supports custom and Google Java Style Guide rules.

**Example Checkstyle rules:**

* Class names must be in PascalCase.
* Maximum method length: 40 lines.
* Field naming pattern: `^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$`

### 2. **Spotless**

**Purpose:** Formats and checks source code for style violations.

**Key Features:**

* Supports Java, Kotlin, Groovy, and more.
* Can use Google Java Format, Eclipse, or Prettier backends.
* Integrates seamlessly with Maven or Gradle builds.

**Use Case:** Add a `spotlessCheck` task to CI pipelines to fail builds if formatting is not compliant.

### 3. **EditorConfig**

**Purpose:** Maintains consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs.

**Key Features:**

* Defines rules like indentation, charset, line endings, and trailing whitespace.
* Works across languages and tools.
* IDEs like IntelliJ, Eclipse, and VS Code support it natively.

**Example `.editorconfig`:**

```
iniCopyEdit[*]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4
end_of_line = lf
charset = utf-8
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
```

### 4. **Google Java Format**

**Purpose:** Opinionated formatter developed by Google for consistent Java formatting.

**Key Features:**

* No custom configuration – "one way to format."
* Integrates with Spotless or can be run as a standalone CLI/IDE plugin.
* Ensures formatting consistency without debates.

**Best Used When:** You want strict formatting with minimal configuration.

### 5. **PMD (Optional for Style)**

**Purpose:** Primarily for code quality, but also enforces style rules (e.g., method length, unnecessary blocks).

**Features Related to Code Style:**

* Avoid deeply nested if-statements.
* Avoid long classes/methods.
* Discourages unused variables and duplicate imports.

### 6. **IDE Code Style Profiles (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA)**

**Purpose:** IDE-based enforcement of formatting and code layout.

**Features:**

* Automatically format code on save or commit.
* Enforce line breaks, brace positions, spacing, import order.
* Export/share code style profiles as XML.

**Best Practice:** Commit shared style configurations into the project repo to standardize across the team.
