# Server vs Container

## About

In the Java ecosystem, the terms **“server”** and **“container”** are often used interchangeably, but they represent different concepts that play distinct roles in application deployment and execution. Understanding the difference between a Java server and a Java container is essential for developers, architects, and operations teams to design, build, and manage Java applications effectively.

A **Java Server** refers to the entire software platform that provides the environment and services necessary to host Java applications. This includes networking capabilities, security management, resource allocation, deployment facilities, and often one or more containers that manage Java components.

On the other hand, a **Java Container** is a specialized runtime environment within the server responsible for managing the lifecycle of specific Java components, such as servlets or Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs). Containers provide the necessary APIs and runtime services that allow these components to function correctly, handling their instantiation, execution, and destruction.

Misunderstanding these concepts can lead to confusion when choosing technologies, troubleshooting issues, or optimizing application performance. This page aims to clarify these terms by highlighting their definitions, roles, differences, and how they work together in the Java server ecosystem.

## How They Work Together ?

Java servers and containers work hand-in-hand to provide a seamless environment for running Java applications. The server acts as the overarching platform that manages network communication, security, deployment, and resource allocation, while containers focus on managing the lifecycle of individual Java components within that platform.

When a client request arrives, the Java server receives and processes it at the network level. It then delegates specific tasks to the appropriate container based on the request type. For example, a servlet container manages HTTP requests directed at servlets or JSPs, ensuring proper instantiation, execution, and destruction of these components.

Containers rely on the server for critical services such as thread management, database connection pooling, and security enforcement. Conversely, servers depend on containers to provide the runtime environment necessary for executing Java components according to specifications like Jakarta EE.

This close cooperation enables developers to build modular, maintainable applications by focusing on component logic within containers, while servers handle infrastructure concerns like scaling, failover, and overall system health.

## Use Cases and When to Focus on Each

Understanding when to focus on the Java server versus the container is important for developers, architects, and operations teams, as each plays a different role in the application lifecycle.

#### When to Focus on Java Servers ?

* **Infrastructure Planning:** When designing the deployment environment, considering scalability, clustering, and failover mechanisms.
* **Security and Resource Management:** When configuring authentication, authorization, connection pooling, and monitoring tools.
* **Application Deployment:** When packaging and deploying complete applications (WAR, EAR) and managing multiple applications on the same platform.
* **Performance Tuning:** When optimizing thread pools, network settings, or server-wide caching strategies.

#### When to Focus on Java Containers ?

* **Component Development:** When writing and managing servlets, JSPs, or Enterprise JavaBeans that run inside the container.
* **Request Lifecycle Management:** When handling specific request processing, session tracking, and component lifecycle events.
* **Component-Specific Configuration:** When configuring filters, listeners, or interceptors specific to servlets or EJBs.
* **Debugging Component Behavior:** When diagnosing issues related to servlet execution, concurrency, or lifecycle callbacks.

By recognizing these distinctions, teams can better allocate responsibilities and streamline both development and operational workflows.

## Example: Developing and Deploying a REST API on Oracle WebLogic Server

Imagine we are developing a RESTful API using Java technologies such as JAX-RS (Jakarta RESTful Web Services). Our goal is to deploy this API on **Oracle WebLogic Server**, a full-featured Java application server.

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Java server (WebLogic)** provides the whole environment and services needed to run our application safely and efficiently. The **container** inside the server takes care of running our specific Java components and handling the details of each client request.
{% endhint %}

### Java Server Role (Oracle WebLogic Server)

* **Hosting Environment:** WebLogic acts as the Java server providing the overall platform where our REST API application runs.
* **Resource Management:** It manages networking, thread pools, database connection pools, security policies, and transaction management essential for robust API operation.
* **Deployment:** WebLogic handles the deployment of our packaged application archive (WAR or EAR), ensuring our API is available and integrated with other enterprise services.
* **Monitoring and Scalability:** It provides tools for monitoring API performance, scaling resources, and ensuring high availability.

{% hint style="success" %}
WebLogic acts like the big platform that hosts our entire application. It manages things like:

* Receiving network requests from clients
* Managing security and user access
* Handling database connections and transactions
* Deploying our application and keeping it running smoothly
{% endhint %}

### Java Container Role (Servlet Container within WebLogic)

* **Component Lifecycle Management:** The embedded servlet container within WebLogic manages the lifecycle of our REST endpoints implemented as servlets or JAX-RS resources.
* **Request Handling:** It processes incoming HTTP requests targeted at our REST API, invokes the appropriate resource classes, and manages request/response objects.
* **Session and Context Management:** Manages HTTP sessions if our API maintains state, and provides context information to our components.
* **Concurrency and Threading:** Handles concurrent processing of multiple REST requests efficiently.

{% hint style="success" %}
Inside WebLogic, there is a smaller part called the servlet container. Its job is to:

* Manage our REST API code components (called servlets or resources)
* Handle each HTTP request by calling the right part of our API
* Manage user sessions and keep track of request data
* Make sure multiple requests can be handled at the same time without conflicts
