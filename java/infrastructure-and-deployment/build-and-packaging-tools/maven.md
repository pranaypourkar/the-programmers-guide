# Maven

## About

Apache Maven is a widely-used build automation and project management tool in the Java ecosystem. It emphasizes convention over configuration, using an XML-based Project Object Model (POM) to define the build process, manage dependencies, and control the project lifecycle. Maven’s extensive plugin system and large central repository make it a reliable choice for standardized builds.
