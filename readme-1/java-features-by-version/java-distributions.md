# Java Distributions

## About

Java distributions are packaged versions of the Java Development Kit (JDK) and/or Java Runtime Environment (JRE) provided by various vendors. These distributions include everything needed to develop, compile, and run Java applications.

## Key Components of Java Distributions

### **Java Development Kit (JDK)**:

* **Compiler (`javac`)**: Converts Java source code into bytecode.
* **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**: Executes Java bytecode on any device or operating system.
* **Core Libraries**: Essential Java libraries required for development.
* **Utilities**: Tools for documentation (`javadoc`), debugging (`jdb`), and other development tasks.

### **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**:

* **JVM**: Runs Java applications.
* **Core Libraries**: Libraries necessary to run Java applications.
* **Runtime Libraries**: Additional libraries and components required for execution.

## Popular Java Distributions:

### **Oracle JDK**:

* Developed and maintained by Oracle.
* Includes commercial features and long-term support (LTS) options for enterprises.
* Free for development and testing; requires a subscription for production use.

### **OpenJDK**:

* An open-source implementation of the JDK.
* Maintained by the Java community and led by Oracle.
* Often the basis for other distributions.

### **Amazon Corretto**:

* A free, multiplatform, production-ready distribution of OpenJDK.
* Maintained by Amazon with long-term support.

### **AdoptOpenJDK (now Eclipse Adoptium)**:

* Provides prebuilt OpenJDK binaries.
* Community-driven and now under the Eclipse Foundation as Eclipse Adoptium.

### **Zulu by Azul Systems**:

* Provides free, certified builds of OpenJDK.
* Offers enterprise support and additional commercial features.

### **Liberica JDK by BellSoft**:

* Provides full and lightweight distributions of OpenJDK.
* Includes support for various platforms and long-term support options.

### **IBM Semeru Runtime**:

* IBM's distribution of OpenJDK.
* Tailored for IBM's hardware and cloud environments, with enterprise support options.

## Why Different Distributions?

* **Support and Maintenance**: Different vendors offer varying levels of support, bug fixes, and security updates.
* **Licensing**: Some distributions are completely free, while others require a subscription for commercial use.
* **Performance and Features**: Vendors may include optimizations and additional features suited for specific environments or use cases.
* **Compliance and Certification**: Ensures compatibility and reliability for enterprise applications.

## Choosing a Distribution:

When selecting a Java distribution, consider the following factors:

* **Support Needs**: Do you need commercial support and long-term updates?
* **Performance Requirements**: Are there performance optimizations specific to your environment?
* **Licensing Terms**: Do you need a distribution with a free or commercial license?
* **Compatibility**: Ensure the distribution is compatible with your development and production environments.
