# Scoped Values

## About

The concept of "Scoped Values" in Java introduces a modern approach to managing shared data within threads or across child threads, offering several advantages over traditional thread-local variables.

#### 1. Immutability

* **Immutability**: Scoped values are inherently immutable, meaning once a value is set, it cannot be changed. This immutability enhances thread safety by eliminating the risks associated with concurrent modifications.
* **Advantages**:
  * **Thread Safety**: Since scoped values cannot be modified, there's no need for synchronization mechanisms to prevent concurrent access issues, simplifying the code and reducing potential bugs.
  * **Predictability**: Immutable data is easier to reason about, as it guarantees that the data remains constant throughout its lifetime.

#### 2. Automatic Lifecycle Management

* **Automatic Cleanup**: Scoped values are designed to automatically clean up when they go out of scope, typically when the thread or the enclosing block in which they are defined exits.
* **Advantages**:
  * **Simplified Memory Management**: This automatic cleanup reduces the burden on developers to manually manage the lifecycle of shared data, which is especially important in preventing memory leaks.
  * **Less Boilerplate Code**: Developers can avoid writing additional code to manage the cleanup process, leading to cleaner and more maintainable codebases.

#### 3. Thread-Safe Sharing

* **Safe Data Sharing**: Scoped values facilitate safe sharing of immutable data between parent and child threads. When a parent thread creates a child thread, it can pass the scoped value to the child, ensuring the child has access to the necessary data.
* **Advantages**:
  * **Isolation with Access**: The child thread has access to the shared data but cannot modify it, maintaining the integrity of the original data.
  * **Concurrent Processing**: Multiple threads can safely access the scoped value simultaneously without the risk of data corruption, which is crucial for high-concurrency applications.

## Comparison with Thread-Local Variables

* **Thread-Local Variables**: Traditional thread-local variables allow each thread to have its own independent instance of a variable. While useful, they can be mutable and require explicit cleanup, which can lead to memory leaks if not handled properly.
* **Scoped Values**: In contrast, scoped values are immutable and automatically managed, providing a more robust and safer way to share data within and across threads.

## Use Cases

* **Configuration and Context Propagation**: Scoped values can be used to propagate configurations or contextual information (e.g., security contexts, user sessions) from a parent thread to its child threads in a safe and immutable manner.
* **Immutable Shared Data**: Any scenario where read-only shared data needs to be accessed by multiple threads can benefit from scoped values, ensuring data consistency and thread safety.
* We may wish to share a userâ€™s identity or permissions between many request threads. Thread-local variables, which have different values for each thread, are one technique.

## Problems with ThreadLocal Variables

1. **Memory Leaks**:
   * **Lifecycle Management**: ThreadLocal variables can cause memory leaks if not properly cleaned up. Since the data associated with a ThreadLocal variable is held as long as the thread exists, in environments with thread pools (e.g., web servers), this data can persist longer than intended.
   * **Thread Pools**: When using thread pools, threads are reused for multiple tasks. If a ThreadLocal variable is not cleared explicitly, its data can inadvertently be reused by subsequent tasks running on the same thread, leading to incorrect behavior and memory leaks.
2. **Complexity and Maintenance**:
   * **Manual Cleanup**: Developers must ensure that ThreadLocal variables are removed or cleaned up explicitly to prevent memory leaks. This adds complexity and increases the chance of bugs, especially in large and complex applications.
   * **Difficulty in Debugging**: Issues related to ThreadLocal variables can be hard to track and debug due to their implicit nature. Understanding and maintaining the flow of ThreadLocal data across different parts of the application can be challenging.
3. **Hidden Dependencies**:
   * **Implicit Data Flow**: ThreadLocal variables can create hidden dependencies within the codebase. This can make the code harder to understand and maintain, as it may not be immediately apparent how data is being shared and modified across different methods and classes.
4. **Concurrency Issues**:
   * **Unintentional Sharing**: In some cases, ThreadLocal variables can lead to subtle concurrency issues, especially if developers mistakenly assume that ThreadLocal variables are entirely isolated and do not require synchronization.
   * **Lack of Immutability**: ThreadLocal variables can be mutable, which can lead to issues if different parts of the application modify the same ThreadLocal variable, leading to unexpected behavior.
5. **Performance Overhead**:
   * **Memory Overhead**: ThreadLocal variables add memory overhead as each thread maintains its own copy of the variable. In applications with a large number of threads, this can lead to increased memory usage.
   * **Garbage Collection**: Improper use of ThreadLocal variables can interfere with efficient garbage collection, as the references held by ThreadLocal variables may prevent objects from being collected even if they are no longer in use.

## Scoped Values as a Solution:

Scoped values aim to address many of these problems by providing an alternative approach to managing shared data within threads or across child threads:

1. **Immutability**: Scoped values are immutable, preventing accidental modifications and improving thread safety without requiring complex synchronization mechanisms.
2. **Automatic Lifecycle Management**: Scoped values are automatically cleaned up when they go out of scope, simplifying memory management and reducing the risk of memory leaks.
3. **Thread-Safe Sharing**: Scoped values enable safe sharing of data between parent and child threads while maintaining immutability, ensuring consistent and predictable behavior.

## Example with ScopedValue

```java
package com.sample;

import java.util.concurrent.*;

// A class representing an immutable scoped value
public class ScopedValue<T> {
    private final T value;

    // Constructor to initialize the scoped value
    public ScopedValue(T value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    // Method to retrieve the scoped value
    public T getValue() {
        return value;
    }

    // main function
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
        // Create a scoped value in the parent thread
        ScopedValue<String> parentScopedValue = new ScopedValue<>("Parent Value");

        // Define a task that will be run in a child thread
        Callable<String> task = () -> {
            // Create a scoped value in the child thread with the same value as the parent
            ScopedValue<String> childScopedValue = new ScopedValue<>(parentScopedValue.getValue());
            // Access the scoped value within the child thread
            return childScopedValue.getValue();
        };

        // Create a single-threaded executor to run the task
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
        // Submit the task to the executor and get a Future representing the task's result
        Future<String> future = executor.submit(task);

        // Print the result from the child thread
        System.out.println("Child thread scoped value: " + future.get());

        // Shut down the executor
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}

```

## Example with ThreadLocal

```java
package com.sample;

import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ThreadLocalExample {
    private static ThreadLocal<String> threadLocal = new ThreadLocal<>();

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        Runnable task1 = () -> {
            threadLocal.set("Task1");
            try {
                // Simulate work
                Thread.sleep(100);
                System.out.println("Task1 ThreadLocal value: " + threadLocal.get());
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            } finally {
                // Clear the ThreadLocal variable
                threadLocal.remove();
            }
        };

        Runnable task2 = () -> {
            threadLocal.set("Task2");
            try {
                // Simulate work
                Thread.sleep(100);
                System.out.println("Task2 ThreadLocal value: " + threadLocal.get());
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            } finally {
                // Clear the ThreadLocal variable
                threadLocal.remove();
            }
        };

        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            executor.submit(task1);
            executor.submit(task2);
        }

        executor.shutdown();
        executor.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
    }
}
```

**Memory Leaks**: Without the `finally` block that removes the ThreadLocal variable, data from previous tasks might persist, leading to memory leaks.

**Hidden Dependencies**: The use of ThreadLocal variables creates hidden dependencies that are not immediately apparent, making the code harder to understand and maintain.

**Concurrency Issues**: If the `finally` block is omitted or if multiple tasks accidentally share the same ThreadLocal variable, it can lead to unexpected behavior and data corruption.
