# Cloud Models

## About

Cloud computing models define how cloud services are deployed and made available to users. These models determine the type of access, management, and responsibility shared between the cloud provider and the customer.

## What are  main Cloud Models ?

### **Public Cloud:**

* **Definition:** A public cloud is owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider, delivering computing resources (like servers, storage, and networking) over the internet. These resources are shared among multiple organizations or tenants (multi-tenancy).
* **Characteristics:**
  * **Accessibility:** Services are available to the general public or large industry groups.
  * **Scalability:** Easily scalable resources based on demand.
  * **Cost-efficiency:** Pay-as-you-go pricing model.
* **Examples:** Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

### **Private Cloud:**

* **Definition:** A private cloud is dedicated exclusively to a single organization, providing computing resources on-premises or hosted off-site by a third-party provider. It offers more control over security, compliance, and customization compared to public clouds.
* **Characteristics:**
  * **Control:** Higher level of control and customization over infrastructure and resources.
  * **Security:** Enhanced security and privacy, suitable for sensitive data and compliance requirements.
  * **Cost:** Potentially higher initial setup and maintenance costs compared to public cloud.
* **Examples:** VMware Cloud Foundation, OpenStack, Microsoft Azure Stack.

### **Hybrid Cloud:**

* **Definition:** A hybrid cloud combines public and private cloud environments, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. It enables businesses to leverage the scalability and cost-effectiveness of public cloud for non-sensitive operations while keeping critical data and applications on-premises or in a private cloud.
* **Characteristics:**
  * **Flexibility:** Applications and workloads can move between public and private clouds as needs and costs change.
  * **Scalability:** Easily scale resources based on demand across both environments.
  * **Data Control:** Control over where sensitive data resides, addressing compliance requirements.
* **Examples:** AWS Outposts, Azure Hybrid Cloud, Google Anthos.

### **Community Cloud:**

* **Definition:** A community cloud is shared by several organizations with common concerns (e.g., regulatory compliance, security requirements, industry-specific needs). It may be managed by the organizations or a third-party provider and can be hosted on-premises or off-site.
* **Characteristics:**
  * **Shared Resources:** Shared infrastructure and services among organizations with similar requirements.
  * **Cost-sharing:** Reduced costs compared to private cloud while maintaining some level of customization and control.
  * **Collaboration:** Facilitates collaboration and data sharing within the community.
* **Examples:** Government community clouds, healthcare community clouds.

## How to choose the Right Cloud Model or **Factors to Consider**?

* **Security and Compliance Requirements:** Consider data sensitivity and regulatory compliance needs.
* **Cost Considerations:** Evaluate upfront costs, operational costs, and potential savings.
* **Performance and Scalability:** Assess the scalability and performance requirements of applications and workloads.
* **Control and Customization:** Determine the level of control and customization needed over infrastructure and resources.
* **Integration and Interoperability:** Consider how well the cloud model integrates with existing IT infrastructure and applications.
