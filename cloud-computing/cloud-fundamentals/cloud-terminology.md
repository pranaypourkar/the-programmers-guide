# Cloud Terminology

## **Resilience and Performance**

### 1. High Availability

The ability to keep services up and running for long periods of time, while experiencing little to no downtime.

### 2. Scalability

The ability to increase or decrease resources for a given workload. We can add resources to service a workload (scale out), or add additional capabilities to handle increases in demand (scale up).

### 3. Elasticity

The ability to automatically or dynamically increase or decrease resources as necessary.

### 4. Agility

The ability to react quickly. Cloud services can allocate and deallocate resources quickly.

### 5. Fault Tolerance

The ability to remain up & running even if a component or service is no longer functioning.

### 6. Disaster Recovery

The ability to recover from a cloud service outage. Cloud services disaster recovery should happen quickly through automation.

## Scaling

### **1. Vertical Scaling**

Increasing the capacity of a single server by adding more resources (CPU, RAM, storage).

### **2. Horizontal Scaling**

Adding more servers to a system to handle increased load, distributing the workload across multiple machines.

## Costing

### 1. Predictive Cost

The ability to predict what costs will be incurred for a particular cloud service or offering.

### **2. Economies of Scale**

Cost advantages that enterprises obtain due to the scale of operation, with cost per unit of output decreasing with increasing scale.

### **3. Capital Expenditure (CapEx)**

Funds used by an organization to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets such as property, industrial buildings, or equipment.

### **4. Operational Expenditure (OpEx)**

Ongoing costs for running a product, business, or system, including expenses such as rent, utilities, and salaries.

## **Security and Compliance**

### **1. Identity and Access Management (IAM)**

Controls and manages user identities and permissions within the cloud environment.

### **2. Encryption**

Securing data in transit and at rest using encryption algorithms.

### **3. Compliance**

Adherence to legal and regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) in cloud operations.

## **Networking and Connectivity**

### **1. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**

Virtual network dedicated to an organization within a public cloud infrastructure.

### **2. Content Delivery Network (CDN)**

Distributed network of servers that delivers content efficiently to users based on their geographic location.

## **Data Management**

### **1. Data Backup**

Copies of data stored separately to ensure data recovery in case of data loss.

### **2. Data Replication**

Creating redundant copies of data across multiple locations or servers for high availability.

## **Monitoring and Management**

### **1. Cloud Monitoring**

Continuous tracking and analysis of cloud resources and applications to ensure performance and availability.

## **Development and Deployment**

### **1. DevOps**

Culture and set of practices that combine software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the systems development life cycle.

### **2. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**

Practices to automate the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes.
