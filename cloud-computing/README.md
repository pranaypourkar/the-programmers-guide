# Cloud Computing

## About

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services including servers, storage, databases, networking, security, software, analytics, and intelligence etc. over the Internet, also called as cloud, to offer faster delivery to market, innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

It is a technology that allows users to access and store data, applications, and services over the internet rather than on local hardware. It provides on-demand delivery of IT resources with pay-as-you-go pricing, enabling businesses and individuals to use computing resources flexibly and efficiently.

## Why is it Called Cloud Computing?

The term "cloud" in cloud computing is metaphorical. It originates from the cloud symbol used in diagrams and flowcharts to represent the internet or an abstract network. The idea is that the details of the network infrastructure are hidden, and users can access resources and services from this "cloud" without needing to know or manage the underlying complexities.

### How Cloud Computing Evolved over time

1. **1960s:**
   * Concept of time-sharing and utility computing was introduced by pioneers like J.C.R. Licklider.
2. **1990s:**
   * Emergence of the internet and virtual private networks (VPNs).
3. **2000s:**
   * Amazon launched AWS in 2006, introducing services like EC2 and S3.
   * Other major players like Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure entered the market.
4. **2010s-Present:**
   * Rapid growth in cloud adoption across various industries.
   * Introduction of advanced services like AI/ML, big data processing, IoT integration.

4. **Innovation:** Cloud platforms offer advanced tools and services that enable rapid innovation, such as AI/ML capabilities, IoT integration, and big data analytics.
5. **Career Advancement:** Proficiency in cloud technologies is highly sought after in the job market, opening up numerous career opportunities.

## Who are Cloud Providers and Consumers?

### Cloud Providers

Cloud providers are companies that offer cloud computing services to businesses and individuals. They own and maintain the hardware and software infrastructure required to deliver various services over the internet.

#### **Major Cloud Providers:**

1. **Amazon Web Services (AWS):** Offers a comprehensive suite of cloud services, including computing power, storage, databases, machine learning, and more.
2. **Microsoft Azure:** Provides a wide range of services, including virtual machines, databases, AI and machine learning, and DevOps tools.
3. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** Delivers cloud services such as computing, storage, databases, big data, machine learning, and networking.
4. **IBM Cloud:** Offers cloud solutions including AI, IoT, and blockchain, along with traditional cloud services.
5. **Oracle Cloud:** Provides cloud applications, platforms, and infrastructure services, with a strong focus on databases.
6. **Alibaba Cloud:** China's leading cloud provider, offering a variety of cloud services like computing, storage, and databases.
7. **Other Notable Providers:**
   * **Salesforce:** Primarily known for its SaaS offerings in CRM and other business applications.
   * **SAP Cloud Platform:** Offers enterprise applications and services.
   * **Tencent Cloud:** Another major Chinese provider, offering a wide range of cloud services.

### Cloud Consumers

Cloud consumers are individuals, businesses, or organizations that use cloud computing services provided by cloud providers. They utilize these services to host applications, store data, process information, and perform other computing tasks without owning the underlying infrastructure.

#### **Types of Cloud Consumers:**

1. **Individuals:** Use cloud services for personal needs, such as email, file storage (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox), and media streaming (e.g., Netflix).
2. **Small and Medium-Sized Businesses (SMBs):** Utilize cloud services for web hosting, data storage, application development, and collaboration tools (e.g., G Suite, Microsoft Office 365).
3. **Large Enterprises:** Employ cloud services for enterprise-level applications, big data processing, machine learning, disaster recovery, and global deployments (e.g., AWS, Azure).
4. **Startups:** Leverage cloud services to quickly scale their operations, develop and deploy applications, and reduce initial infrastructure costs.
5. **Government and Public Sector:** Use cloud services for e-government initiatives, data storage, and public service applications (e.g., healthcare, education).
6. **Educational Institutions:** Implement cloud solutions for online learning platforms, data storage, and research projects.
7. **Developers:** Use cloud platforms for application development, testing, and deployment. They benefit from services like containerization (e.g., Kubernetes), serverless computing, and CI/CD pipelines.

### **How Cloud Consumers get Benefited?**

1. **Cost Savings:** Reduce or eliminate the need for investing in and maintaining physical infrastructure.
2. **Scalability:** Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.
3. **Flexibility:** Access a wide range of services and tools to build, deploy, and manage applications.
4. **Global Reach:** Leverage a global network of data centers to deploy applications closer to users.
5. **Innovation:** Access cutting-edge technologies like AI, machine learning, big data analytics, and IoT.
6. **Disaster Recovery and High Availability:** Utilize built-in redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure data protection and service continuity.

## How Cloud Computing Works Behind the Scene

1. **Data Centers:**
   * Cloud providers operate large data centers filled with servers that store and process data. These data centers are located globally to ensure redundancy and low latency.
2. **Virtualization:**
   * Cloud computing relies heavily on virtualization technology, which allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical server. This enables efficient resource utilization.
3. **Service Models:**
   * **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
   * **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** Offers hardware and software tools over the internet, typically needed for application development.
   * **SaaS (Software as a Service):** Delivers software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis.
4. **APIs and Management Interfaces:**
   * Cloud providers offer APIs and management interfaces for users to interact with the services, automate tasks, and manage resources.
