# LDAP

## About

**LDAP** stands for **Lightweight Directory Access Protocol**. It is an open, vendor-neutral, industry-standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an IP network. It was initially developed as a lightweight alternative to DAP (Directory Access Protocol, part of X.500) and has since become the **de facto standard** for centralized authentication and directory services.

A directory in LDAP is a **read-optimized**, hierarchical database used primarily for **lookup operations**, not for transactional data. It plays a critical role in enterprise **identity and access management (IAM)**.

LDAP is widely used for authentication and authorization in enterprise environments, and acts as a central repository for user, group, and organizational data.

## Evolution and Standards

* Originally specified in **RFC 1487**, later formalized in **RFC 4510** and related specifications.
* LDAP is based on the **X.500** standard but uses **TCP/IP** and a simplified data encoding mechanism (**BER â€“ Basic Encoding Rules** over ASN.1).
* The most commonly used version is **LDAPv3**.
