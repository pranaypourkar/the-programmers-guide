# Authentication

## About&#x20;

Securing user access to applications and data is more critical than ever. Authentication, the process of verifying the identity of a user or system, plays a foundational role in safeguarding systems from unauthorized access and protecting sensitive information. This verification can take many forms, each tailored to balance security with user convenience.

## Core Principles of Authentication

1. **Identity Verification**: Ensures that the person or entity trying to gain access is authentic.
2. **Access Control**: Grants or denies access based on the authenticated identity.
3. **Security and Privacy**: Protects sensitive data by limiting access to authorized users.

## Categories of Authentication Factors

Authentication methods are often categorized by the type of "factor" they use. These factors are based on different forms of verification:

* **Something You Know**: Information only the user should know, like a password or PIN.
* **Something You Have**: A physical item in the user's possession, like a smartphone, security token, or smart card.
* **Something You Are**: Unique biological traits, such as fingerprints, facial features, or retinal patterns (biometrics).
* **Somewhere You Are**: Location-based authentication, where access is granted based on the userâ€™s geographic location.
* **Something You Do**: Behavioral patterns, like typing speed, rhythm, or swiping patterns on a touch screen.
