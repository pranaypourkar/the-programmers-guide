# Server in Java

## About

In the context of Java, a server is a software application that listens for requests from clients and provides responses to those requests. Servers in Java can handle various types of tasks, including serving web pages, processing business logic, managing databases, and more. Java servers can be categorized into different types based on their functionality, deployment environment, and the protocols they support.

## Different Types of Servers in Java

1. **Web Servers**
   * **Definition**: Web servers handle HTTP requests and responses. They serve static content such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.
   * **Examples**:
     * **Apache Tomcat**: An open-source web server and servlet container developed by the Apache Software Foundation.
     * **Jetty**: Another open-source project providing an HTTP server, HTTP client, and javax.servlet container.
     * **Netty**: An asynchronous event-driven network application framework that can be used for building high-performance protocol servers.
2. **Application Servers**
   * **Definition**: Application servers provide an environment for running and managing web applications. They support dynamic content generation and business logic execution.
   * **Examples**:
     * **JBoss (WildFly)**: An open-source Java EE-based application server maintained by Red Hat.
     * **Oracle WebLogic**: A robust, enterprise-level application server from Oracle.
     * **IBM WebSphere**: An enterprise-level application server from IBM.
     * **GlassFish**: An open-source Java EE application server sponsored by Oracle.
3. **Microservices Frameworks**
   * **Definition**: These frameworks facilitate the development and deployment of microservices, small, independent, and loosely coupled services.
   * **Examples**:
     * **Spring Boot**: A framework that simplifies the creation of stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
     * **Dropwizard**: A Java framework for developing RESTful web services.
4. **Servlet Containers**
   * **Definition**: Servlet containers, also known as servlet engines, manage the lifecycle of servlets, map URLs to servlets, and ensure the delivery of web applications.
   * **Examples**:
     * **Apache Tomcat**: Acts as both a web server and a servlet container.
     * **Jetty**: Provides a servlet container along with HTTP server capabilities.
5. **Enterprise Service Buses (ESBs)**
   * **Definition**: ESBs provide a middleware layer that facilitates communication between different enterprise applications. They offer routing, transformation, and integration services.
   * **Examples**:
     * **Apache ServiceMix**: An open-source ESB based on the Apache Camel routing and mediation engine.
     * **WSO2 ESB**: An open-source ESB that supports REST, SOAP, and other protocols.
6. **Message-Oriented Middleware (MOM) Servers**
   * **Definition**: MOM servers facilitate message exchange between distributed systems. They support reliable and asynchronous communication.
   * **Examples**:
     * **Apache ActiveMQ**: An open-source message broker written in Java.
     * **RabbitMQ**: Though written in Erlang, it can be integrated with Java applications.
     * **Kafka**: A distributed streaming platform that can be used as a message broker.
7. **Database Servers**
   * **Definition**: Database servers manage database storage, retrieval, and manipulation. They handle SQL queries and transactions.
   * **Examples**:
     * **Apache Derby**: A lightweight, open-source relational database implemented in Java.
     * **H2 Database Engine**: An open-source, lightweight, embedded, and server-mode database written in Java.
8. **File Servers**
   * **Definition**: File servers manage file storage, access, and transfer operations.
   * **Examples**:
     * **Apache FTP Server**: An open-source Java-based FTP and FTPS server.
     * **JFileServer**: A simple Java file server for file transfer operations.
9. **Game Servers**
   * **Definition**: Game servers manage online multiplayer game environments, handling game state synchronization and player communication.
   * **Examples**:
     * **Apache Mina**: A network application framework that can be used to create game servers.
     * **Netty**: Often used for building high-performance game servers.

## Where does spring boot application fit?

Spring Boot is designed to simplify the development of stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications, including microservices. It provides embedded servlet containers (like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow) by default, making it easy to package and run applications without needing an external application server.

{% hint style="info" %}
While Spring Boot applications can be deployed to traditional application servers, they are commonly deployed as standalone JAR files or Docker containers, leveraging cloud-native deployment practices and container orchestration platforms (like Kubernetes).
{% endhint %}

When we create a standalone Spring Boot application, it usually comes with an embedded web server. This web server allows our application to run independently without requiring an external web or application server to be installed. The most common embedded web servers used in Spring Boot are:

* **Apache Tomcat** (default)
* **Jetty**
* **Undertow**

These embedded web servers provide the necessary environment to serve web requests and handle HTTP interactions.

### Functionalities of Embedded Web Servers

**Web Server Functionalities:**

* **HTTP Request Handling**: Serves HTTP requests and responses.
* **Servlet and JSP Support**: Provides support for Java servlets and JSP pages.
* **Static Content Serving**: Serves static content such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
* **Security**: Basic security features like HTTPS, authentication, and authorization.
* **Session Management**: Manages user sessions and cookies.

### Comparison with Full-Fledged Application Servers

A full-fledged application server, such as JBoss EAP, Oracle WebLogic, or IBM WebSphere, offers more advanced features beyond what an embedded web server provides. These additional features are tailored for enterprise applications and complex deployment environments.

**Application Server Functionalities:**

* **Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB)**: Support for EJBs, which provide a framework for developing modular enterprise applications.
* **Transaction Management**: Advanced transaction management, including distributed transactions.
* **JMS (Java Message Service)**: Messaging capabilities for asynchronous communication.
* **JCA (Java Connector Architecture)**: Integration with legacy systems and enterprise information systems.
* **JPA (Java Persistence API)**: Advanced ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database interactions.
* **Resource Management**: Connection pooling, JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) for resource lookup.
* **High Availability and Clustering**: Features for clustering, load balancing, and failover.
* **Advanced Security**: Comprehensive security models, including role-based access control (RBAC), LDAP integration, and more.
