# Tools

## About

API testing requires specialized tools that help developers and testers interact with APIs, send requests, validate responses, and automate tests. These tools make it easier to ensure the API behaves correctly, handles edge cases, and meets performance expectations. They also help teams debug and inspect API calls quickly without writing code for every interaction.

Modern API tools support a variety of features such as:

* Building and sending HTTP requests
* Viewing and validating response data
* Automating API test cases
* Mocking servers and simulating behavior
* Integrating into CI/CD pipelines

## Categories of API Tools

API tools come in many forms, each tailored to support a specific part of the API lifecycle—whether we are testing endpoints manually, automating validations, simulating unavailable services, or monitoring live traffic. Here’s a breakdown of the main categories:

### **1. Manual API Testing Tools**

These tools allow users to send requests to an API and inspect responses manually using a visual interface. They’re especially useful during development, debugging, or exploratory testing when we need quick feedback.

* **Use Case**: Quickly check if an endpoint works, experiment with request parameters, or understand how an API behaves.
* **Example Tools**: Postman, Insomnia

### **2. Automated API Testing Tools**

These tools are designed for writing test cases and automating them as part of our testing pipeline. They often integrate with CI/CD systems, making it easy to run tests after every build or deployment.

* **Use Case**: Ensure APIs function correctly over time, catch regressions, and validate expected behavior automatically.
* **Example Tools**: REST Assured (Java), Karate, Newman (Postman CLI), JMeter (for performance and load)

### **3. Command-Line API Tools**

These lightweight tools allow users to interact with APIs using the command line. They're fast, scriptable, and ideal for quick tests or integrating with shell scripts and automated workflows.

* **Use Case**: Make requests directly from the terminal, automate test scripts, or add API calls in deployment pipelines.
* **Example Tools**: `curl`, `httpie`, `wget`

### **4. Mocking and Simulation Tools**

When the actual API or dependent services aren’t available, mocking tools simulate API responses. This is especially helpful during frontend development or when working with third-party services.

* **Use Case**: Test components without relying on real backend services, simulate error cases or latency, and unblock parallel development.
* **Example Tools**: WireMock, Postman Mock Server, Mockoon

### **5. API Documentation & Exploration Tools**

Some tools combine testing with auto-generated documentation. They allow teams to visualize endpoints, test them, and share them with internal or external developers.

* **Use Case**: Create interactive API documentation, onboard developers, and test endpoints from a web interface.
* **Example Tools**: Swagger UI, Redoc, Postman Collections

### **6. Monitoring and Observability Tools**

These tools continuously monitor API performance, uptime, and correctness in production environments. They alert teams if something breaks or slows down.

* **Use Case**: Ensure our live APIs are healthy, performant, and meet SLAs, even after deployment.
* **Example Tools**: Postman Monitors, Runscope, New Relic, Datadog
