# Filtering

## About

Filtering is the process of retrieving only the specific data that meets certain criteria from a larger dataset. Instead of returning every record and leaving it up to the client to sort through the results, filtering allows the server to deliver only what’s relevant.

In APIs, filtering is typically done by passing parameters in the request such as query strings, request bodies, or headers that define the conditions a record must meet to be included in the response.

For example, a products API might let us filter by category, price range, or brand, while a user API could allow filtering by location, account status, or registration date.

Effective filtering not only improves performance and reduces network load but also enhances user experience by making sure responses are concise and relevant.

## Why Filtering Matters ?

Without filtering, every API request would return the full dataset, forcing the client to process and discard irrelevant data. This is not only inefficient but also costly in terms of bandwidth, server load, and user experience.

Filtering matters for several key reasons:

* **Performance Optimization** – By narrowing down the dataset at the server level, responses are faster and consume fewer resources.
* **Reduced Network Traffic** – Smaller, more targeted responses minimize the amount of data transferred.
* **Better User Experience** – Users see only the most relevant results, improving engagement and usability.
* **Scalability** – Filtering helps maintain performance even as datasets grow.
* **Compliance & Security** – Filters can ensure sensitive or restricted data is never exposed unnecessarily.

## Filtering Techniques

### **1. Exact Match Filtering**

* **What it is**: Returns only records where a field exactly matches the provided value.
* **Example**:\
  `/products?category=electronics` → Returns only products where `category` is exactly "electronics".
* **Use Cases**: Ideal for categorical data like product categories, status fields, or user roles.
* **Pros**: Simple to implement, predictable results.
* **Cons**: Limited flexibility; can’t handle partial matches or ranges.

### **2. Partial Match Filtering (Substring Search)**

* **What it is**: Returns records that match part of a value, often using wildcard or pattern matching.
* **Example**:\
  `/products?name_contains=phone` → Matches "Smartphone", "Headphone", etc.
* **Use Cases**: Useful for search boxes, keyword filtering, and name matching.
* **Pros**: More flexible than exact match.
* **Cons**: Can be slower on large datasets without proper indexing.

### **3. Range Filtering**

* **What it is**: Returns data where values fall between a specified lower and upper bound.
* **Example**:\
  `/products?price_min=100&price_max=500`
* **Use Cases**: Price ranges, date ranges, or numerical limits.
* **Pros**: Efficient for numerical and date-based filtering.
* **Cons**: Needs careful handling for open-ended ranges (e.g., min only).

### **4. Boolean Filtering**

* **What it is**: Uses true/false values to include or exclude certain records.
* **Example**:\
  `/products?in_stock=true`
* **Use Cases**: Filtering by availability, active/inactive states, published/unpublished content.
* **Pros**: Extremely fast and easy to implement.
* **Cons**: Limited to binary conditions.

### **5. Multi-Value Filtering**

* **What it is**: Allows multiple values for the same field in a single request.
* **Example**:\
  `/products?category=electronics,books`
* **Use Cases**: When users want to see results from multiple categories at once.
* **Pros**: Reduces the need for multiple API calls.
* **Cons**: Requires careful handling of commas or arrays in query parameters.

### **6. Complex Conditional Filtering**

* **What it is**: Combines multiple filter types with AND/OR logic.
* **Example**:\
  `/products?category=electronics&price_max=500&in_stock=true`
* **Use Cases**: Advanced dashboards, analytics tools, complex search systems.
* **Pros**: Very flexible and powerful.
* **Cons**: Parsing and validation logic can get complex; risk of performance degradation without indexing.

### **7. Fuzzy Search Filtering**

* **What it is**: Matches approximate values rather than exact matches.
* **Example**: Searching “iphne” might still match “iPhone.”
* **Use Cases**: Search engines, user-generated content, spell-check-friendly APIs.
* **Pros**: Great for usability.
* **Cons**: Requires advanced search engines like Elasticsearch or PostgreSQL full-text search.

### **8. Faceted Filtering**

* **What it is**: Allows filtering on multiple grouped attributes, often used in e-commerce.
* **Example**:\
  `/products?brand=apple&color=black&storage=128gb`
* **Use Cases**: Filtering in product catalogs with multiple attributes.
* **Pros**: Great for multi-attribute datasets.
* **Cons**: Can produce large, complex queries if not optimized.

## Choosing the Right Technique

Selecting the right filtering approach depends on factors like **data size**, **query complexity**, **user needs**, and **performance goals**. The wrong choice can lead to slow responses, excessive database load, or overly complex API endpoints.

**1. Understand our Data Type**

* **Exact Match** works best for fixed values (e.g., order status, country codes).
* **Range Filtering** is ideal for numeric and date fields.
* **Fuzzy Search** is better for free-text fields like product names or descriptions.

**2. Analyze User Requirements**

* If users often type in search boxes → **Partial Match** or **Fuzzy Search**.
* If users prefer filters like checkboxes → **Multi-Value Filtering** or **Faceted Filtering**.
* If they need advanced analytics → **Complex Conditional Filtering**.

**3. Balance Flexibility vs. Performance**

* **Fuzzy Search** and **Complex Filtering** provide more flexibility but can slow down queries.
* **Exact Match** and **Boolean Filters** are faster but less flexible.
* Consider **indexing** columns in the database to improve speed.

**4. Consider API Client Complexity**

* If we want to keep client-side code simple, avoid overly complex filter syntax.
* Instead, expose multiple **simple filters** rather than one massive “query” parameter with nested JSON.

**5. Plan for Scalability**

* On small datasets, almost any technique works well.
* On large datasets, choose filtering that can leverage **database indexes** efficiently.
* For **real-time search** in large datasets, consider integrating with search engines like **Elasticsearch** or **OpenSearch**.

**6. Use a Hybrid Approach Where Needed**

* Many APIs mix filtering techniques — for example:
  * **Exact Match** for category
  * **Range Filtering** for price
  * **Fuzzy Search** for product name
* This ensures optimal **usability** and **performance**.

**7. Keep Pagination in Mind**

* Filtering and pagination go hand in hand.
* Always apply filtering **before** pagination in the query to avoid inconsistent results.

## Best Practices for Filtering

Filtering in APIs can quickly become messy if not designed well. Following best practices ensures our API remains **easy to use**, **consistent**, and **performant**.

#### 1. **Keep Filtering Syntax Simple and Consistent**

* Use clear, predictable parameter names.
  * Example: `?status=active` is better than `?q1=active`.
* If we support multiple filters, keep the style uniform.
  * Example: `?status=active&category=books` instead of mixing formats.

#### 2. **Support Multiple Values When Useful**

* Allow users to filter by more than one value for the same field.
  * Example: `?status=active,inactive` or `?status=active&status=inactive`.
* This saves multiple API calls.

#### 3. **Apply Filtering Before Pagination**

* Always run filters before pagination logic to ensure consistent results.
* Filtering **after** pagination can skip valid results or cause duplicates between pages.

#### 4. **Validate and Sanitize Filter Inputs**

* Prevent **SQL injection** or performance issues by validating inputs.
* Reject impossible or nonsensical filters early (e.g., negative prices, invalid dates).

#### 5. **Use Appropriate Data Types**

* Match the filter parameter type with the field type in our data.
  * Example: Use integers for IDs, not strings.
* Helps avoid type conversion overhead.

#### 6. **Document Supported Filters Clearly**

* List all available filters in our API docs, including:
  * Field name
  * Accepted values or ranges
  * Examples of usage
* This reduces trial-and-error for API consumers.

#### 7. **Consider Indexing Frequently Filtered Fields**

* Database indexes drastically improve filtering performance.
* Particularly important for large datasets.

#### 8. **Support Partial and Exact Matching Where Appropriate**

* For text fields, allow both exact match (`status=active`) and partial search (`name=contains:john`).
* Use a consistent convention for specifying these.

#### 9. **Use Search Engines for Heavy Filtering Needs**

* If our API needs complex searches (fuzzy search, ranking, scoring), integrate with **Elasticsearch**, **OpenSearch**, or similar tools.

#### 10. **Be Mindful of Performance on Large Filters**

* Large `IN` queries (`status=1,2,3,4,5,6`) can hurt performance.
* Consider caching or breaking them into smaller calls.
