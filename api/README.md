# API

## About

An API, or Application Programming Interface, serves as **an interface or set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other**. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. APIs are used to enable integration between different software systems, allowing them to work together seamlessly. They provide a standardized way for developers to access the functionality of a software platform, service, or library without needing to understand its internal workings. In essence, APIs act as bridges that enable the exchange of data and functionality between different software components, enabling developers to build more powerful and interconnected applications.
