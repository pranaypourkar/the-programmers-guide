# API Specification

## API-first approach

The API-first approach is a development methodology where the API is designed and documented before any implementation work begins. It emphasizes creating a clear and well-defined API specification as the first step in the development process, allowing teams to align on requirements, functionality, and expectations before writing code . Via API Description Languages, teams can collaborate without having implemented anything, yet. Those description languages **specify endpoints, security schemas, object schemas, etc**. Moreover, most of the time we can also generate code such a specification or server stub as interface and model classes and use in the service integration project.

## **Why Use API Specifications?**

API specifications act as a contract between API and its consumers. It promotes standardization and consistency across different services and teams. They define how the API works, including:

* **Endpoints (URLs):** The locations where users can access API functionality.
* **Methods (Verbs):** The HTTP methods used to interact with the API (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
* **Parameters:** The data that can be passed to the API.
* **Responses:** The data structure and format of the response from the API.

## **Benefits of API-First**

* **Improved Design:** Taking an API-first approach forces us to think thoroughly about how our application will be consumed, leading to a well-defined and consistent API.
* **Flexibility and Reusability:** Well-designed APIs are modular and reusable across different applications and integrations.
* **Faster Development:** By planning the API upfront, we can streamline development and avoid rework later.
* **Enhanced Developer Experience:** A well-documented API with clear specifications makes it easier for developers to understand and integrate with your application.

## API Specification Formats

1. **OpenAPI (OAS, formerly Swagger)**: Industry-standard API specification format for RESTful APIs. Supports JSON and YAML formats and provides extensive tooling and ecosystem support. It is most widely used and comprehensive API specification language.
2. **RAML (RESTful API Modeling Language)**: YAML-based language for describing RESTful APIs. Focuses on simplicity, readability, and reusability.
3. **API Blueprint**: Markdown-based language for describing APIs. Designed for simplicity and ease of use, suitable for rapid prototyping and documentation.
4. **GraphQL SDL (Schema Definition Language)**: Language for defining GraphQL schemas. Specifies types, queries, mutations, etc., in a concise and human-readable format.

## Features of API Specification

1. **Endpoints**: Define API endpoints, including paths, HTTP methods, and parameters.
2. **Request/Response Formats**: Specify request and response payloads, including headers, body schema, and media types (e.g., JSON, XML).
3. **Authentication/Authorization**: Define authentication and authorization mechanisms supported by the API.
4. **Error Handling**: Describe error responses and status codes returned by the API.
5. **Security**: Specify security requirements, such as HTTPS, OAuth, API keys, etc.
6. **Versioning**: Define versioning strategy and URL structure for versioning.
7. **Documentation**: Include descriptive documentation, examples, and usage guidelines for each API endpoint.
