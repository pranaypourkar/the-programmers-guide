# Backward Compatibility

I have 3 Spring boot services and they have their respective openapi specification repo

Rest API 1 is being called by Rest API 2 and Rest API 3.\
Suppose Rest API 2 need more fields in the response of Rest API 1. If we update the response param of Rest API 1 then will it impact Rest API 3?
