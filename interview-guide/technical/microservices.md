# Microservices

## About

Includes frequently asked microservice architecture questions—service decomposition, communication patterns, circuit breakers, and distributed tracing. Useful for mid-to-senior-level backend interviews.

## 1. "Have You Worked with Microservices? If So, Can You Explain the Architecture?"

### **Sample Points to Cover**

* Microservices architecture.
* Communication between services (REST, gRPC, messaging).
* Handling failures (circuit breakers, retries).
* Event-driven approach or SAGA etc.

### Sample Answer

Yes, I have worked extensively with microservices architecture. In one of my projects, we broke down a monolithic application into multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific business domain. We used REST APIs for communication and RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging between services. To handle failures gracefully, we used Resilience4j for circuit-breaking and retries. We also implemented the SAGA pattern to manage long-running transactions across multiple services, ensuring eventual consistency.

## 2. "**How Do You Ensure High Availability and Fault Tolerance in a Java Backend Application?"**

### **Sample Points to Cover**

* Redundancy, failover, load balancing.
* Database replication.
* Use of cloud services (if applicable).
* Monitoring and alerting.

### Sample Answer

<summary>Backend Engineer Role</summary>

To ensure high availability and fault tolerance, I focus on building a robust infrastructure. We use load balancers to distribute traffic evenly across multiple instances of our backend services. For database redundancy, we implement master-slave replication for failover. Additionally, we deploy our application on AWS with auto-scaling enabled to handle traffic spikes. For monitoring, we use Prometheus and Grafana to keep track of system health, and we’ve set up alerts to proactively identify and resolve issues before they impact users.

## 3. "How Do You Handle Performance Optimization in Backend Projects?"

### **Points to Cover**

* Identifying performance bottlenecks.
* Optimizing databases, APIs, or algorithms.
* Use of caching, load balancing, or asynchronous processing.
* Tools for profiling and monitoring performance.

### Sample Answer

<summary>Backend Engineer Role</summary>

Performance optimization is something I prioritize from the outset. I typically start by profiling the application to identify performance bottlenecks, using tools like JProfiler and VisualVM. For example, in a previous project, we optimized a resource-intensive API by implementing caching using Redis and optimizing database queries with better indexing. We also moved some heavy processing to background tasks using Spring’s @Async feature to avoid blocking the main thread. After deploying, I used Prometheus and Grafana to monitor and ensure everything was running efficiently.
