# Java Practice Programs

## About

This section provides:

* Short programs focused on logic, patterns, recursion, or collections.
* Edge-case awareness (nulls, bounds, time complexity).
* Common questions like reversing strings, Fibonacci series, anagram checks, etc.
* Solutions follow a clean coding approach and often include both iterative and recursive variants.
