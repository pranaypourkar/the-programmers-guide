## **Does Spring Boot is used only for building Rest APIs?**

No, Spring Boot is not only for building REST APIs. While it's true that Spring Boot provides support for building RESTful web services with its embedded HTTP servers and extensive libraries, it's not limited to just that. Spring Boot is a mechanism for auto-configuring a Spring Framework based application. Therefore it can be used for all other items like -&#x20;

* REST APIs for webservices
* SOAP based services
* Full web application using Spring MVC
* Reactive web applications
* WebSocket applications
* Command line tools
* Batch jobs
* Swing / JavaFX applications
