# SQL Practice Problems

## About

Interviews often include live or take-home SQL tests. This section teaches:

* Writing effective **SELECT**, **JOIN**, **GROUP BY**, **HAVING**, and **SUBQUERY** statements.
* Solving problems using **window functions**, **ranking**, and **CTEs**.
* Writing optimized queries for performance (index usage, avoiding N+1).
* Use-case-driven challenges like top-N queries, gaps in sequences, duplicate detection, etc.
