# Interview Guide

## About

Interviews test more than just knowledge — they evaluate your problem-solving process, communication style, adaptability, and depth of experience. This section offers a structured pathway to prepare across both technical and non-technical dimensions. It’s designed for students, fresh graduates, and experienced developers aiming for top-tier software roles. The goal is not only to help you answer questions but also to understand **why** certain questions are asked and **how** to approach them with clarity and confidence.
