## How to write ATS friendly resume ?

Creating an ATS (Applicant Tracking System) friendly resume is essential for ensuring that application gets noticed by recruiters. Here are some key features and tips for making resume ATS compatible:

2. **Keyword Optimization**:
   * Use relevant keywords from the job description throughout your resume. These should include skills, job titles, and industry-specific terms.
   * Include both the full term and abbreviations (e.g., "Search Engine Optimization (SEO)").
3. **Clear Section Headings**:
   * Use standard headings such as "Work Experience," "Education," "Skills," and "Certifications."
   * Place headings on their own lines to ensure they are easily recognizable by the ATS.
4. **Consistent Formatting**:
   * Use bullet points for listing job duties and achievements.
   * Keep dates in a consistent format (e.g., MM/YYYY or Month Year).
5. **Standard Fonts and Font Sizes**:
   * Stick to common fonts and use a size between 10 and 12 points.
   * Avoid using headers and footers, as some ATS may not read them.
6. **Contact Information**:
   * Place your name, phone number, email address, LinkedIn profile etc. at the top of the resume.
   * Avoid placing contact details in headers or footers.

   * List jobs in reverse chronological order, starting with the most recent position.
   * Include job titles, company names, locations, and dates of employment.
8. **Education**:
   * Include your degrees, schools attended, and graduation dates.
   * If you are a recent graduate, place the education section near the top of the resume.
9. **Skills Section**:
   * Create a dedicated skills section that lists relevant skills in a simple format.
   * Include both hard and soft skills relevant to the job you are applying for.
10. **File Type**:
    * Submit your resume in a format that ATS can read, such as a Word document (.doc or .docx) or a plain text file (.txt).
    * Avoid submitting PDFs unless the job posting specifically requests this format, as some ATS might have difficulty parsing them.
11. **Avoid Tables and Columns**:
    * Use simple bullet points and avoid using tables, text boxes, or columns which might not be parsed correctly.
