# Projections

## About

In NoSQL databases, **projections** refer to the ability to retrieve only specific fields or parts of a document or record during a read operation. Rather than returning the entire data object, projections allow clients to **selectively fetch** only the data they actually need.

This concept is especially important in document stores like **MongoDB**, but it also applies more broadly across other NoSQL systems that support field-level access - such as **Cassandra**, **DynamoDB**, or **ElasticSearch**.

For example, instead of retrieving an entire customer document with dozens of nested fields, a projection might retrieve only the customer’s name and email address.

This selective retrieval provides several important advantages:

* **Reduces data transfer size** over the network.
* **Improves query performance** by avoiding unnecessary disk I/O.
* **Enhances security and privacy** by hiding sensitive or irrelevant fields.
* **Simplifies application logic** by returning only what’s needed.

Projections align well with NoSQL's flexible schema and nested data structures, enabling efficient access patterns tailored to specific use cases.

## How Projections Work ?

Projections in NoSQL databases work by **selectively including or excluding specific fields** from the documents or records that match a query. The exact implementation and syntax vary by database, but the core idea remains the same: **we control which parts of a record are returned** to optimize performance and reduce payload size.

Let’s break it down by mechanics and examples:

#### **1. Field Inclusion and Exclusion**

Most NoSQL databases offer two modes of projection:

*   **Inclusion**: Specify the fields we want to retrieve.\
    Example (MongoDB):

    ```js
    db.users.find({ status: "active" }, { name: 1, email: 1 })
    ```

    → Returns only the `name` and `email` fields of active users.
*   **Exclusion**: Specify the fields we want to omit.\
    Example:

    ```js
    db.users.find({ status: "active" }, { password: 0, lastLogin: 0 })
    ```

    → Returns all fields **except** `password` and `lastLogin`.

**Note**: Inclusion and exclusion generally cannot be mixed in a single projection (except for the `_id` field in MongoDB).

#### **2. Nested and Array Field Projections**

Document-oriented databases like MongoDB support **deep projections** into nested fields and arrays.

Example:

```js
db.orders.find({}, { "customer.name": 1, "items.productId": 1 })
```

This returns only the customer’s name and product IDs from the `items` array, skipping the rest.

#### **3. Projections in Column-Family Databases**

In **Cassandra**, projections are done by specifying column names in the `SELECT` clause:

```sql
SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE status = 'active';
```

Cassandra is optimized for reading narrow slices of data, so projections are common practice.

#### **4. Partial Document Retrieval in Key-Value Stores**

While simpler key-value stores like **Redis** often require fetching entire objects, some implementations (like RedisJSON) allow retrieving specific paths within a stored object:

```bash
JSON.GET user:123 $.email
```

#### **5. Projections in Search Engines**

Search-oriented databases like **ElasticSearch** allow us to define **source filtering** to control which fields are returned with matched documents:

```json
"_source": ["title", "summary"]
```

This makes result payloads lighter and faster to deliver in large search queries.

#### **6. Server-Side vs. Client-Side Projections**

* **Server-side projections** (most common) ensure that only the selected fields are retrieved and sent over the network.
* **Client-side filtering** is discouraged because it retrieves full records and trims them afterward, wasting bandwidth and increasing response time.

## Benefits of Projections

Projections in NoSQL databases offer a range of practical and performance-related advantages. By allowing applications to fetch only the necessary parts of a document or record, projections enable more efficient and focused data access. This becomes especially important in systems dealing with high volumes of traffic, large datasets, or deeply nested document structures.

Below are the key benefits of using projections in NoSQL:

#### **1. Reduced Data Transfer**

Projections significantly reduce the amount of data sent from the database to the client by excluding unnecessary fields. This:

* Minimizes bandwidth usage.
* Speeds up API response times.
* Reduces mobile or low-bandwidth latency.

This is especially impactful in systems where documents contain large binary fields (e.g., images, logs, or embedded arrays) that aren’t always needed.

#### **2. Improved Query Performance**

Retrieving fewer fields means the database engine can:

* Read less data from disk or memory.
* Avoid decompressing entire documents.
* Spend less time formatting and serializing data.

In performance-sensitive applications, these savings add up and result in **faster query execution and better scalability**.

#### **3. Lower Memory Footprint on Clients**

When clients (e.g., front-end apps, mobile devices, microservices) receive smaller payloads, they consume less memory to parse and hold the data. This:

* Improves app performance.
* Enables better responsiveness for users.
* Reduces pressure on edge systems with limited memory.

#### **4. Enhanced Security and Privacy**

Projections make it easier to **exclude sensitive or private fields** such as passwords, tokens, PII (Personally Identifiable Information), or internal-only attributes.

By limiting data at the query level, projections reduce the risk of exposing sensitive information unintentionally - especially in shared or public APIs.

#### **5. Simpler and Cleaner API Responses**

When using projections, API responses contain only the relevant fields, which:

* Simplifies response parsing on the client side.
* Reduces the need for post-processing or filtering logic.
* Helps enforce consistency across endpoints and applications.

This is especially useful in REST or GraphQL-based systems where clean, predictable payloads are essential.

#### **6. Better Index Usage in Some Databases**

In some NoSQL systems like MongoDB, projections combined with proper indexing can result in **covered queries** - where all the required data can be fetched directly from the index without touching the actual document. This leads to:

* Extremely fast queries.
* Less load on storage layers.
* Efficient use of caching.

#### **7. Alignment with Front-End or UI Requirements**

User interfaces rarely need full records. Projections allow backends to tailor queries to just what the UI needs, such as:

* Listing summaries with just `title`, `author`, and `date`.
* Auto-complete inputs requiring only `name` or `id`.
* Lightweight mobile views where speed is more important than detail.

#### **8. Reduced Serialization Overhead**

Less data retrieved means less work for the server and client in terms of:

* JSON encoding/decoding.
* Data marshaling and transformation.
* Logging and tracing (if data is logged for observability).

This results in a **smoother overall data processing pipeline**.
