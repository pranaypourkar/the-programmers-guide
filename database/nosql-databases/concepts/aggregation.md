# Aggregation

## About

Aggregation in NoSQL refers to the process of **combining, transforming, or summarizing data -** typically across multiple records - to derive meaningful insights or perform analytical queries. While the term is traditionally associated with SQL operations like `GROUP BY`, NoSQL systems support their own forms of aggregation, tailored to the specific data models and query engines they use.

Unlike relational databases, NoSQL systems often store data in **denormalized** or **hierarchical formats**, such as JSON documents or nested key-value pairs. This allows them to support powerful in-place aggregation techniques - sometimes even **within a single record -** while still offering flexible tools for **cross-document or cross-collection aggregations**.

Aggregation is especially important in applications involving **analytics, reporting, dashboards, metrics, and summaries**, where raw data needs to be processed into actionable information.

## Aggregation Techniques

Aggregation in NoSQL varies across different types of databases, each offering distinct methods and levels of support depending on their data model and query capabilities. Here are the core techniques commonly used:

### **1. Aggregation Pipelines (Document Stores)**

Used prominently in databases like **MongoDB**, an aggregation pipeline processes data through a **sequence of transformation stages**, much like a UNIX pipe.

Each stage performs an operation (e.g., filtering, grouping, projecting, sorting) and passes the result to the next stage. For example:

```json
[
  { "$match": { "status": "active" } },
  { "$group": { "_id": "$category", "total": { "$sum": "$amount" } } },
  { "$sort": { "total": -1 } }
]
```

**Advantages**

* Modular and composable.
* Operates efficiently over indexed and nested data.
* Supports in-place document restructuring.

### **2. MapReduce**

**MapReduce** is a distributed aggregation model used by systems like **Couchbase**, **HBase**, and earlier versions of MongoDB.

* The **Map function** emits key-value pairs.
* The **Reduce function** consolidates values by key.

Itâ€™s suitable for large datasets processed in parallel, although it has been largely superseded in performance by more modern techniques like aggregation pipelines.

### **3. Built-in Aggregation Functions**

Many NoSQL databases offer native support for common aggregations like:

* `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`
* Percentiles and histogram-like bucket functions
* Time-based aggregations (e.g., grouping by day/week)

Databases like **Cassandra (CQL)** and **DynamoDB (via PartiQL)** support such queries over indexed fields, but often with restrictions on grouping or filtering.

### **4. Client-Side Aggregation**

In systems where the server doesn't support full aggregation, data is **fetched in bulk and processed at the application layer**. This approach is common in:

* **Redis**, which is fast but intentionally minimal.
* **Simple key-value or object stores**.

**Trade-offs**

* Higher network and memory usage.
* More logic pushed to the application code.
* No parallel processing or pushdown optimization.

### **5. Materialized Views**

Some NoSQL databases offer **precomputed or automatically maintained summaries** called materialized views. For instance:

* **Cassandra** allows creating views to track computed subsets of tables.
* **MongoDB** supports `$merge` to write pipeline results into collections.

These are useful for **frequently accessed aggregations** that are too costly to compute on the fly.

### **6. Time-Series Aggregation**

For systems designed around **time-series data** (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB on PostgreSQL, or even MongoDB with time-series collections), aggregation tools are tailored to:

* Downsample high-resolution data (e.g., 1-min to 5-min intervals).
* Compute rolling averages, deltas, trends.
* Support gap-filling, interpolation, and time-windowed analysis.

## Use Cases for Aggregation

Aggregation in NoSQL databases enables a wide range of analytical and real-time data processing use cases. It allows developers to derive insights, compute metrics, and build intelligent systems without offloading work to external tools or relational databases.

Below are some of the most common and valuable scenarios where aggregation plays a central role:

#### **1. Real-Time Dashboards and Monitoring**

Aggregation is essential for building live dashboards that display:

* Active user counts by region.
* Total sales or revenue metrics per hour/day.
* System health metrics like error rates, CPU/memory usage, or API latency.

In systems like **MongoDB**, **Cassandra**, or **InfluxDB**, these aggregations can be performed efficiently and incrementally for real-time updates.

#### **2. E-commerce and Sales Analytics**

Retail and e-commerce platforms often use NoSQL to track and summarize:

* Orders per product category.
* Total revenue by user or location.
* Inventory availability and low-stock alerts.
* Customer segmentation based on purchase behavior.

Document and columnar stores are well-suited to compute these insights, especially when denormalized data models are used.

#### **3. Behavioral and Usage Tracking**

Applications that collect user interactions - like page views, clicks, or in-app activity - rely on aggregation to:

* Group actions by session or user.
* Count feature usage or engagement trends.
* Detect drop-offs in user flows or onboarding funnels.

These workloads are a natural fit for **schema-flexible** databases like MongoDB or event stores built atop **Cassandra**, **ScyllaDB**, or **ElasticSearch**.

#### **4. IoT and Time-Series Summarization**

IoT systems collect data from devices at high frequency. Aggregation is used to:

* Downsample raw readings into 1-minute, 5-minute, or hourly buckets.
* Detect anomalies or sensor thresholds.
* Compute rolling averages or deltas over time windows.

Databases optimized for time-series (like **InfluxDB**, **MongoDB** time-series collections, or **Druid**) offer advanced time-windowed aggregations.

#### **5. Fraud Detection and Anomaly Monitoring**

Aggregation helps detect outliers or suspicious activity by summarizing:

* Unusually high login attempts.
* Transactions over thresholds.
* Rapid changes in behavior compared to norms.

Aggregation pipelines or MapReduce can scan logs or transactional data for such patterns in near real time.

#### **6. Content Recommendations and Popularity Metrics**

Content platforms aggregate data to understand:

* Most viewed or liked items.
* Recently trending articles, videos, or products.
* User preferences based on consumption patterns.

These metrics are often computed via incremental aggregations and stored in **caches or materialized views** for fast access.

#### **7. Reporting and Compliance Audits**

In regulated industries, summarizing data is necessary for:

* Periodic reporting (e.g., daily/monthly summaries).
* Financial reconciliation.
* Compliance with data retention or accuracy requirements.

NoSQL databases may support these through **aggregation jobs**, **scheduled queries**, or integration with **reporting layers**.

#### **8. Social Features and Notifications**

Social networks aggregate data to power features like:

* Post likes, shares, comments counts.
* Group or channel activity summaries.
* Follower/following stats.

These aggregations can be precomputed and stored as part of the user or content document, then incrementally updated on interaction.

#### **9. Machine Learning Feature Engineering**

Before feeding data into ML models, developers often need to compute:

* Aggregated historical features (e.g., last 7-day average spend).
* User profile summarizations.
* Click or conversion rates.

NoSQL aggregation allows for **scalable, high-volume preprocessing** over semi-structured or time-based data.

#### **10. Data Migration and Transformation**

During schema changes or system upgrades, aggregation helps:

* Reshape data into a new structure.
* Consolidate multiple collections/tables into one.
* Validate counts or detect missing records.

Aggregation pipelines can be used for these one-time transformations before writing back into the updated schema.
