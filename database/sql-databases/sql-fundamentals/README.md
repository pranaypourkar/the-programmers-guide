# SQL Fundamentals

## About

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is the standard language used to communicate with relational databases. It allows us to create, read, update, and delete data (commonly known as **CRUD operations**), as well as define database structures, manage access, and control transactions.

The **SQL Fundamentals** section covers the core building blocks of the SQL language. This includes commands, clauses, operators, and datatypes that form the basis for interacting with any relational database systemâ€”be it Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, or others.
