# SQL Data Types

## About

SQL data types define the kind of values that can be stored in a database column. They are part of the SQL standard and ensure that data is stored, processed, and retrieved in a consistent way.

SQL data types are broadly categorized into:

* **Numeric Types** – for storing numbers (integers, decimals, etc.).
* **Character Types** – for storing text strings.
* **Date & Time Types** – for storing dates, times, and timestamps.
* **Large Object Types** – for storing large binary or text data like images, documents, or media files.

Understanding data types is fundamental to designing effective database schemas and ensuring data integrity.
