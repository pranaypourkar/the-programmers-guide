# SQL

## Overview

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a programming language which is used to manage data stored in relational databases like MySQL,  SQL Server, Oracle, Postgres etc. Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language. Most of the SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard.
