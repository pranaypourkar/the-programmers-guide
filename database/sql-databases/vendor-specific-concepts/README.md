## About

Although SQL is governed by a standard, different database vendors implement their own enhancements, features, and syntax variations to address performance, scalability, or specific use cases. This section focuses on those vendor-specific implementations. It helps differentiate between standard SQL behavior and features that are unique to particular database systems such as Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.
