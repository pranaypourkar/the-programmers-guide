# DBMS

## About

Database management system is a software which is used to manage the database and facilitates the creation, maintenance, and usage of databases. For example: MS SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, etc are a popular commercial database which is used in different applications. It also provides protection and security to the database.

**DBMS allows users to do following tasks**

* **Data Definition:** Creation, modification, and removal of definition that defines the organization of data in the database.
* **Data Updation:** Insertion, modification, and deletion of the actual data in the database.
* **Data Retrieval:** Retrieve the data from the database which can be used by applications for various purposes.
* **User Administration:** Registering and monitoring users, maintain data integrity, enforcing data security, dealing with concurrency control, monitoring performance and recovering information corrupted by unexpected failure.

## **Features of DBMS**

* **Data Modeling:** A DBMS offers tools to define the structure and relationships between different data elements. This ensures data organization and reduces redundancy.
* **Data Storage and Retrieval:** The DBMS is responsible for storing data efficiently and providing functionalities to search, filter, and retrieve data based on specific criteria.
* **Concurrency Control:** A DBMS manages access to the database when multiple users try to modify data simultaneously. This prevents conflicts and ensures data integrity.
* **Data Integrity and Security:** A DBMS enforces data integrity rules to maintain data accuracy and offers security features to restrict unauthorized access.
* **Backup and Recovery:** A DBMS provides mechanisms for backing up your data and recovering it in case of system failures or data corruption.

## **Benefits of Using a DBMS**

* **Improved Data Organization:** Data is structured and easier to manage compared to spreadsheets or flat files.
* **Enhanced Data Security:** User access controls and data encryption minimize security risks.
* **Efficient Data Retrieval:** Structured data allows for faster and more efficient data retrieval using queries.
* **Data Sharing and Collaboration:** Multiple users can access and share data seamlessly, facilitating collaboration.
* **Data Integrity and Consistency:** Data validation and constraints ensure data accuracy and reduce inconsistencies.

## Disadvantages of DBMS

* **Cost of Hardware and Software:** It requires a high speed of data processor and large memory size to run DBMS software.
* **Size:** It occupies a large space of disks and large memory to run them efficiently.
* **Complexity:** Database system creates additional complexity and requirements.
* **Higher impact of failure:** Failure is highly impacted the database because in most of the organization, all the data stored in a single database and if the database is damaged due to electric failure or database corruption then the data may be lost forever.
* **Price**: Need to purchase license of the product for commercial use.
