# Soak Testing

## About

**Soak Testing** (also known as **Endurance Testing**) is a type of performance testing that evaluates how a system behaves under a sustained workload for an extended period of time.\
The goal is to detect issues that only emerge after prolonged operation, such as memory leaks, slow performance degradation, database connection exhaustion, or log file growth.

Unlike stress or spike testing, which focus on short-term high load or sudden surges, soak testing is about **long-term stability** under realistic or slightly above-average load conditions.\
It is especially important for applications that must run continuously, such as financial systems, e-commerce platforms, streaming services, and SaaS products.

## Purpose of Soak Testing

* **Identify Long-Term Performance Degradation**\
  Detect gradual slowdowns or increasing error rates that appear only after hours or days of continuous operation.
* **Detect Memory Leaks and Resource Exhaustion**\
  Observe whether memory, CPU, disk space, or file handles are released correctly over time.
* **Verify Stability Under Continuous Load**\
  Ensure the application remains fully functional and responsive during extended operation without restarts.
* **Assess System Resilience**\
  Evaluate the ability to maintain throughput and response time over prolonged periods.
* **Validate Infrastructure Reliability**\
  Confirm that servers, databases, queues, and network components remain healthy and balanced over long workloads.
* **Support Capacity and Maintenance Planning**\
  Determine the frequency of maintenance windows, restarts, or scaling adjustments needed for smooth operation.

## Aspects of Soak Testing

Soak testing focuses on **long-term stability and resource health** rather than short-term performance spikes.\
The following aspects help uncover hidden issues that may only appear after sustained operation:

#### 1. **Performance Stability Over Time**

Monitors whether response times, throughput, and error rates remain consistent throughout the test duration.

* Detects gradual performance degradation caused by unoptimized code or inefficient resource management.

#### 2. **Resource Utilization Trends**

Tracks CPU, memory, disk I/O, network bandwidth, and file handles over long periods.

* Useful for identifying memory leaks, handle leaks, and slow-growing resource consumption.

#### 3. **Error Rate Accumulation**

Observes if small, intermittent errors accumulate into larger failure patterns over time.

* Can indicate issues such as stale cache data, exhausted connections, or retry loops.

#### 4. **Database Connection and Pool Health**

Ensures that database connections are correctly opened, used, and closed over time without exhaustion or locking issues.

#### 5. **Log Growth and Storage Management**

Validates that log files and other persistent storage are rotated or cleared to avoid disk space exhaustion.

#### 6. **Session and State Management**

Checks if user sessions, authentication tokens, and in-memory caches are managed correctly without bloating over time.

#### 7. **Infrastructure Resilience**

Evaluates whether load balancers, messaging systems, and background jobs continue functioning correctly under sustained use.

## When to Perform Soak Testing ?

Soak testing is most effective when planned for situations where **long-term stability is critical** or **continuous operations cannot be interrupted**. Common scenarios include:

* **Before Go-Live of High-Availability Systems**\
  To ensure stability over extended operational hours without downtime.
* **For Applications Requiring Continuous Uptime**\
  Such as banking systems, streaming platforms, telecom applications, and healthcare software.
* **Before Peak Usage Periods with Long-Running Sessions**\
  For example, online gaming tournaments, tax filing portals, or holiday sales where systems run continuously.
* **After Major Code or Infrastructure Changes**\
  To confirm that new releases do not introduce resource leaks or performance degradation over time.
* **When Validating Background Jobs and Scheduled Tasks**\
  Such as batch processing, nightly syncs, or periodic cache refreshes, to ensure they do not degrade performance.
* **For Cloud Auto-Scaling Validations Over Time**\
  To check that scaling policies work reliably not just for short bursts but over days of sustained load.

## Soak Testing Tools

The choice of soak testing tools depends on the duration, complexity, and metrics you want to capture. Tools should be able to run **steady workloads for hours or days** while integrating with monitoring systems.

#### **Load Generation**

* **Apache JMeter** – Supports long-duration test plans with steady-state workloads and periodic peaks.
* **k6** – Script-based load testing tool ideal for automating soak tests in CI/CD pipelines.
* **Gatling** – Scala-based performance tool with detailed scripting for prolonged testing scenarios.
* **Locust** – Python-based framework capable of running distributed soak tests for extended durations.

#### **Cloud & Distributed Testing**

* **BlazeMeter** – Cloud platform for running long-duration tests with global load distribution.
* **AWS Distributed Load Testing** – AWS-native solution for simulating sustained workloads.
* **Azure Load Testing** – Suitable for multi-hour load scenarios integrated with Azure Monitor.

#### **Monitoring & Observability**

* **Grafana + Prometheus** – For real-time metric visualization and alerting during long test runs.
* **New Relic, Datadog, AppDynamics** – For application-level monitoring over extended periods.
* **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** – For analyzing logs and error patterns during soak tests.

## Best Practices

#### 1. **Run Tests for Realistic Durations**

* Duration should be long enough to reveal gradual failures—often 8 hours, 24 hours, or multiple days.

#### 2. **Use Production-Like Load Profiles**

* Simulate steady, realistic workloads with periodic small peaks to mimic natural usage patterns.

#### 3. **Monitor Everything Continuously**

* Track not only performance metrics but also system health indicators like memory usage, garbage collection frequency, and open connection counts.

#### 4. **Include Warm-Up Periods**

* Let the system stabilize before measurement to ensure caching, JIT compilation, and background processes settle.

#### 5. **Plan for Recovery Validation**

* After the soak period, measure how quickly the system returns to optimal performance and confirm no data corruption occurred.

#### 6. **Automate Test Execution and Data Collection**

* Use automation to avoid manual intervention, which could influence results.

#### 7. **Integrate with Maintenance Schedules**

* Use soak testing results to determine if periodic restarts, clean-ups, or scaling adjustments are needed.

#### 8. **Combine with Monitoring and Alerting**

* Integrate soak test execution with observability tools (e.g., Grafana, Prometheus, New Relic) to catch issues in real time.
