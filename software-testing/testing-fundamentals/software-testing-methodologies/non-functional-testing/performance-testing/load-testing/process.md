# Process

### **About**

This describes the full lifecycle of planning, designing, executing, and analyzing a load test. It is written to support teams who want to perform meaningful, repeatable, and scalable load testing as part of their QA or DevOps practices.

### **1. Define the Objective**

Start by answering **why** you are performing the load test. Without a clear objective, the test may not provide actionable insights.

Common objectives include:

* Validate system behavior under expected traffic
* Confirm response time meets service-level targets
* Identify scalability limits or bottlenecks
* Evaluate performance after infrastructure or code changes
* Validate that recent changes do not degrade throughput

Document your objective. Make it specific and measurable.

### **2. Understand the System Under Test (SUT)**

Gain a complete understanding of what you are testing. This includes:

* APIs, services, databases, and frontends involved
* Third-party dependencies (e.g., payment gateways, auth services)
* Environment details (e.g., staging or pre-prod configuration)
* Any limits, such as API rate limiting or queue size

Establish the scope: are you testing a single component or end-to-end flow?

### **3. Collect Usage and Load Requirements**

Use production logs, analytics, or stakeholder input to determine:

* Expected number of concurrent users or sessions
* Peak vs average load
* Session duration and think times
* Request distribution across endpoints (e.g., 80% GET, 20% POST)
* Historical spikes or seasonal traffic patterns

Without this data, your load test risks being unrealistic or irrelevant.

### **4. Design Test Scenarios**

Define how virtual users will behave during the test.

For example:

* 70% of users log in and fetch dashboard
* 20% download reports
* 10% trigger background jobs

Include:

* Authentication
* Navigation flows
* Data dependencies (e.g., valid user IDs or tokens)
* Wait times between actions

Design scenarios to simulate **real-world usage**, not just raw request volume.

### **5. Choose the Right Tool**

Select a load testing tool based on:

* Target system type (API, UI, database)
* Team skills (e.g., scripting in JavaScript, Python, DSL)
* Support for distributed execution
* Reporting and integrations

Examples:

* **JMeter** for GUI-driven configuration and complex scripting
* **k6** for developer-centric JavaScript scripting
* **Gatling** for concise DSL-based tests
* **Locust** for Python scripting flexibility

### **6. Prepare the Test Environment**

The environment should closely match production:

* Same hardware configuration
* Same database size or indexing
* Same network latency, authentication, and middleware

Ensure:

* Monitoring and logging are enabled
* Autoscaling (if any) is configured as it would be in production
* No other teams are testing or deploying during your test window

### **7. Generate or Load Test Data**

Many scenarios require:

* Auth tokens or API keys
* Valid user accounts or customer records
* Pre-existing data (e.g., product catalog, transaction history)

Options:

* Static CSV data
* Dynamic data generation
* REST API calls in setup phase
* Test-specific database snapshots

Avoid using production data directly to prevent risk of leakage.

### **8. Script and Configure the Test**

Build test scripts that include:

* Defined user flows
* Parameterization of inputs (e.g., user IDs)
* Assertions (e.g., status code = 200)
* Think times and pacing
* Configurable test duration, ramp-up time, and concurrency

Validate scripts locally using small thread counts before scaling.

### **9. Execute the Test**

Start with a **dry run** or **baseline run**:

* Check environment readiness
* Validate monitoring and log collection
* Confirm no errors in script logic

Then run the actual load test:

* Start with ramp-up period
* Maintain load for steady-state duration
* Collect results at regular intervals

Avoid making configuration changes during the test run.

### **10. Monitor System Behavior During Execution**

Monitor key components:

* Application servers: CPU, memory, thread pool usage
* Databases: connections, query times, locks
* Queues: backlog size, consumer lag
* API gateways: rate limits, throttling
* Logs: exceptions, timeouts, garbage collection activity

Use dashboards (e.g., Grafana, CloudWatch, Prometheus) to observe in real-time.
