# Strategy

## About

A **load testing strategy** is a structured plan that defines how, when, and what to test under expected or varying user load. It combines real-world usage data with controlled test design to evaluate system performance under realistic stress.

The goal is to simulate **expected user behavior** using defined tools, environments, and metrics to measure **responsiveness, stability, and scalability**.

## **Why Strategy Matters**

* Avoids unrealistic or useless test results
* Helps detect bottlenecks with purpose
* Supports business-critical decision making (e.g., capacity planning)
* Ensures resource and time efficiency in test cycles

## **Elements of Load Testing Strategy**

### 1. **Test Scope**

Define what part of the system you are testing:

* A single API endpoint or a full flow
* Web UI performance under multiple sessions
* Backend processing queues or database throughput

Decide the depth (individual services vs. integration) and breadth (how many user flows).

### 2. **Load Profile Design**

Plan how the virtual users will interact with the system:

* Concurrent user count
* Ramp-up and ramp-down timings
* Test duration
* Think times (delay between actions)
* Pacing (how fast requests are sent)

Different profiles simulate:

* Steady load
* Spike load
* Gradual increase
* Long-duration (soak) load

### 3. **Data Strategy**

* Identify required data (user accounts, tokens, payloads)
* Use parameterization to simulate realistic variability
* Generate or load large datasets to avoid caching artifacts
* Ensure test data is isolated, repeatable, and clean

### 4. **Environment Strategy**

Use a test environment that mirrors production as closely as possible:

* Similar CPU, memory, networking, and storage
* Identical configurations (DB indexes, JVM settings)
* Monitoring agents and logging pipelines active

Clearly document differences if any exist.

### 5. **Tool Selection**

Choose tools based on:

* Target system type (API, UI, async service)
* Team experience
* Scripting needs (code vs GUI)
* Integration with CI/CD

Examples:

* **APIs** → JMeter, k6, Gatling, Locust
* **UI** → JMeter (WebDriver), Taurus + Selenium
* **Services/Queues** → JMeter with JMS/AMQP plugins

## **Strategies by Target Type**

Load testing should be tailored to the **nature of the component** under test. Different targets behave differently under load, require different tools and setups, and produce different types of performance signals.

### **1. API Load Testing Strategy**

APIs are the backbone of most applications and are commonly tested under load to verify that they can:

* Handle concurrent requests efficiently
* Respond within acceptable time limits
* Scale with user growth
* Fail gracefully under pressure

#### Theoretical Considerations:

* APIs are **stateless** or **session-based**. Stateless APIs (like REST) allow easier concurrency simulation, while session-based (e.g., OAuth2 flows) require user/token management.
* APIs are often part of distributed architectures, and may indirectly stress DBs, caches, message queues, etc.
* Load testing APIs can reveal hidden N+1 queries, thread pool exhaustion, or cache misses.

#### Strategic Guidelines:

* **Define critical endpoints** based on business value or volume (e.g., login, search, checkout).
* Simulate realistic **request volumes** and **user flows** (not just isolated endpoints).
* Include **header handling**, **auth tokens**, and **rate-limiting logic** in scripts.
* Parameterize inputs to avoid unrealistic caching effects.
* Assert response status, timing, and structure (e.g., HTTP 200 with valid JSON).

#### Example:

Simulate 1,000 users performing a 4-step journey: login → dashboard → search → download.

### **2. UI Load Testing Strategy**

User interface load testing involves simulating browser-based interactions. While typically less scalable due to rendering overhead, it is essential for:

* Measuring end-user experience under concurrent usage
* Validating frontend performance and resource optimization
* Detecting layout or JS-related issues at scale

#### Theoretical Considerations:

* Browser-based load testing is **resource-intensive**, so it’s not designed for high concurrency.
* UI performance depends not only on server responses but also on **client-side execution**, network latency, and rendering speed.
* Use only when backend API performance alone cannot answer UX-related concerns.

#### Strategic Guidelines:

* Use tools like Selenium, Playwright, or WebDriver for low-scale testing.
* Keep UI load tests short, focused on specific flows (e.g., login, navigation).
* Run UI tests in parallel but with low thread counts (10–50 users).
* Combine with API tests for backend coverage at higher concurrency.

#### Example:

Test 25 users logging in, navigating to the profile page, and updating a setting.

### **3. Backend Services Load Testing Strategy**

Backend services often include:

* Message queues and consumers
* Background jobs
* File processing
* Event-driven workflows
* Internal APIs

These are less user-facing but critical for internal performance and scalability.

#### Theoretical Considerations:

* Load comes not from HTTP traffic but from **message ingestion**, scheduled jobs, or **system triggers**.
* Such systems may exhibit **non-linear performance** under load due to thread pools, blocking I/O, or queue lag.
* Testing must account for **queue backlog, latency, and throughput**, rather than just request-response timing.

#### Strategic Guidelines:

* Simulate message ingestion using test producers (e.g., JMeter Kafka plugins).
* Monitor queue depth, consumer lag, job duration, and retries.
* Load test batch processing jobs by increasing batch size or input frequency.
* Validate the system’s ability to **scale horizontally** (e.g., more consumers).

#### Example:

Send 10,000 messages to a Kafka topic at a steady rate and monitor processing speed and DLQ entries.

### **4. Database Load Testing Strategy**

Databases are a common bottleneck under heavy load. Load testing at the DB level helps validate:

* Query optimization
* Connection pool management
* Lock contention and transaction handling
* Indexing effectiveness
* Read/write scaling

#### Theoretical Considerations:

* Direct DB load testing is uncommon; usually DB load is **indirect**, triggered by API/service interaction.
* The DB is a **shared stateful system** and must be tested under **controlled data conditions** to avoid inconsistency.
* Performance depends on both schema design and data distribution (e.g., skewed joins, hot keys).

#### Strategic Guidelines:

* Use realistic data sets (not empty DBs).
* Profile query plans before and after load tests.
* Monitor query time, locks, slow query logs, and DB CPU.
* Combine with API/service load testing to evaluate E2E impact.

#### Example:

Simulate 100 users creating orders while another 50 users browse product listings. Monitor connection pool usage and query latency.

### **5. Third-Party Integration Load Strategy**

Modern applications often depend on external APIs — for payment, geolocation, analytics, authentication, and more. Load testing involving third-party services must be handled with care.

#### Theoretical Considerations:

* Hitting third-party APIs during load tests can result in **unexpected billing, throttling, or bans**.
* These systems are typically **rate-limited** and not intended to receive bulk test traffic.
* Real responses are not always required — mocking is often more appropriate.

#### Strategic Guidelines:

* Use service virtualization or local mocks during testing.
* Simulate errors (e.g., timeouts, 500 errors) to verify fallback mechanisms.
* If testing real endpoints, coordinate with providers and limit volume.

#### Example:

Mock payment gateway responses with fixed latency and inject random failures to observe application resilience under peak checkout load.

### **6. Microservices / Distributed System Load Testing Strategy**

In systems composed of microservices, load testing a single service may not expose cross-service latencies, bottlenecks, or failures. Distributed systems require coordinated testing across boundaries.

#### Theoretical Considerations:

* Services may fan out requests (e.g., API gateway → auth → order → inventory → payment), amplifying load.
* Distributed tracing and correlation IDs are essential for tracking performance across hops.
* Failure in one downstream service may impact multiple upstream components.

#### Strategic Guidelines:

* Identify key workflows that traverse multiple services.
* Include all dependencies in the environment or mock them carefully.
* Use telemetry (e.g., OpenTelemetry, Jaeger) to capture full request lifecycle.
* Test for cascading failures and retry storms.

#### Example:

Simulate 200 users placing orders, resulting in distributed calls across 7 services. Monitor latency breakdown and circuit breaker behavior.

## **Metrics and Validation Strategy**

Define your measurement targets:

* Average, median, and percentile response times (e.g., 95th < 1.5s)
* Error thresholds (e.g., < 1% 5xx errors)
* Throughput (e.g., ≥ 500 requests/second)
* System resource thresholds (e.g., CPU < 75%)
* Functional correctness (e.g., valid data responses)

Decide which test is a pass/fail based on business SLAs.
