# Scenario Matrix Template

## About

A **Scenario Matrix Template** for **Acceptance Testing** is a structured tool used to validate whether the **entire system meets business requirements** and is ready for delivery to the customer or deployment to production.\
Acceptance testing is typically **the final phase** of the software testing lifecycle and is often performed by **end users, stakeholders, or QA teams simulating real user conditions**.

This matrix ensures:

* All **business-critical scenarios** are verified against agreed requirements
* The system aligns with **user expectations** in real-world conditions
* Defects or gaps are identified before final sign-off
* Compliance, usability, and operational readiness are validated

Acceptance testing scenarios often focus on **business flows, real-world data, user roles, operational readiness, and sign-off criteria**.
