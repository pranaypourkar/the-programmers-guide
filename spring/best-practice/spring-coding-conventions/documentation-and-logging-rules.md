# Documentation & Logging Rules

## About

**Documentation & Logging Rules** define guidelines for **writing clear code documentation and using logging effectively** in a Spring project. Proper documentation ensures that code is understandable and maintainable, while structured logging enables **troubleshooting, auditing, and monitoring**.

These rules cover:

* Javadoc conventions for classes, methods, and fields.
* Inline comments for complex logic.
* Logging practices using Spring-supported frameworks like SLF4J / Logback / Log4j2.
* Guidelines for log levels, messages, and context enrichment.

## Purpose

The purpose of **Documentation & Logging Rules** is to ensure that the Spring application code is **readable, maintainable, and observable** during runtime.

Key objectives include:

1. **Improve code readability and maintainability**
   * Clear documentation helps developers understand class responsibilities, method behavior, and complex logic.
2. **Support troubleshooting and monitoring**
   * Consistent logging provides actionable insights for debugging, error tracking, and performance monitoring.
3. **Enforce standardized logging practices**
   * Ensures log levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`) are used appropriately, and log messages are meaningful and structured.
4. **Enable compliance and auditing**
   * Proper logging practices support audit trails for security and business-critical operations.
5. **Facilitate team collaboration**
   * Standardized documentation and logging conventions make it easier for new team members to understand and maintain code.

#### Rules

## **1. Class and Interface Documentation**

* All public classes and interfaces should have **Javadoc comments** describing:
  * Purpose of the class/interface.
  * Responsibilities and behaviour.
  * Key interactions with other components.
*   Example structure:

    ```java
    /**
     * Service class responsible for managing Employee entities.
     * Handles CRUD operations and business validation.
     */
    public class EmployeeService { ... }
    ```

## **2. Method Documentation**

* Public and protected methods should include **Javadoc** specifying:
  * Purpose of the method.
  * Input parameters (`@param`).
  * Return type (`@return`).
  * Exceptions thrown (`@throws`).
* Inline comments can be used sparingly for **complex logic or calculations**.

## **3. Logging Practices**

* Use **SLF4J** (`LoggerFactory`) for logging instead of `System.out.println`.
* Log messages should be **clear, descriptive, and contextual**.
  * Include identifiers like IDs, user information, or transaction context where applicable.
* Use appropriate **log levels**:
  * `DEBUG` – Detailed technical information for developers.
  * `INFO` – High-level events (e.g., user login, transaction processed).
  * `WARN` – Recoverable issues or unexpected behavior.
  * `ERROR` – Exceptions or failures requiring investigation.

## **4. Exception Logging**

* Exceptions should be logged with stack trace and meaningful messages.
* Avoid logging sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII).
*   Example:

    ```java
    log.error("Failed to process employee with ID {}: {}", employeeId, e.getMessage(), e);
    ```

## **5. Audit and Business Logging**

* Log important business events (e.g., approvals, payments, critical updates) using a **dedicated audit logger** or structured logging format.

## **6. Consistency**

* Use **consistent log message format** across the application.
* Follow standard terminology and casing for log messages (e.g., “User created successfully” not “user CREATED”).

## **7. Documentation Updates**

* Update class/method documentation whenever the **behavior, parameters, or outputs** change.
* Ensure deprecated methods/classes are **documented with `@deprecated` tags**.
