# Spring Coding Conventions

## About

**Spring Coding Conventions** is a centralized reference for the **architecture, coding, and design standards** recommended for Spring-based projects. It defines a set of **rules and best practices** that guide developers in writing **consistent, maintainable, and high-quality Spring applications**.

This page is intended to cover **structural rules, coding patterns, annotation usage, forbidden APIs, and package organization**, serving as a single source of truth for both **developers and automated enforcement tools** like ArchUnit.

By following these conventions, teams can ensure:

* **Consistent codebase** across modules and projects
* Clear **layer separation** (Controller, Service, Repository, Domain)
* Proper usage of Spring **stereotype annotations** (`@Controller`, `@Service`, `@Repository`)
* Avoidance of **legacy or unsafe APIs**
* Easier **code review, maintenance, and onboarding** of new developers

This page forms the foundation for both **manual adherence** and **automated enforcement**, allowing Spring projects to maintain **robust architecture and coding discipline** over time.

## Purpose

The purpose of the **Spring Coding Conventions** page is to provide a **clear and authoritative guide** for developers on how to write Spring applications in a **consistent, maintainable, and scalable way**.

Specifically, it aims to:

1. **Define standardized coding practices**
   * Establish rules for naming, package structure, annotations, and class placement.
2. **Enforce architectural discipline**
   * Ensure layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository → Domain) is consistently followed.
3. **Promote code quality and readability**
   * Reduce complexity, prevent architectural erosion, and make the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
4. **Support automated rule enforcement**
   * Provide a reference for tools like **ArchUnit**, which can programmatically validate compliance with the conventions.
5. **Facilitate team collaboration**
   * Create a shared understanding of standards, making code reviews more effective and onboarding faster for new developers.

In short, this section **bridges the gap between theory and practice**, helping teams write better Spring code while enabling automated checks to maintain long-term architectural integrity.

## Benefits

Following the **Spring Coding Conventions** provides multiple advantages for teams and projects:

1. **Consistency Across the Codebase**
   * Standardizes **naming, package structure, and annotation usage**, making the code predictable and easy to navigate.
2. **Improved Maintainability**
   * Clear rules for **layered architecture** and **dependency management** reduce technical debt and simplify refactoring.
3. **Better Readability and Understanding**
   * Developers can quickly understand the purpose and role of a class, method, or module by following consistent conventions.
4. **Enhanced Collaboration**
   * Teams share a **common standard**, reducing friction in code reviews and enabling faster onboarding of new developers.
5. **Reduced Risk of Architectural Violations**
   * Ensures proper **layer separation**, **annotation usage**, and avoids misuse of forbidden APIs.
   * Helps prevent **tight coupling, cyclic dependencies, and architectural drift**.
6. **Support for Automated Enforcement**
   * Provides a **reference for tools like ArchUnit** to programmatically enforce rules and detect violations early in the development cycle.
7. **Higher Code Quality and Reliability**
   * By following established best practices, applications are **more robust, scalable, and easier to debug**.
