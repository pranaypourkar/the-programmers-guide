# Reference APIs

## About

The **Reference APIs** section provides **end-to-end, runnable examples** of how to implement various types of APIs using **Spring Boot**. These examples are designed to demonstrate real-world patterns and best practices across different technologies and integration patterns.

This page serves as a **practical reference** for developers looking to quickly understand how to build or integrate systems using different API technologies in Spring Boot.

## **Purpose**

* Showcase complete, working examples of different API styles
* Highlight differences in configuration, tooling, and implementation
* Serve as a learning and copy-paste-ready resource
* Demonstrate recommended practices (error handling, DTOs, versioning, etc.)
