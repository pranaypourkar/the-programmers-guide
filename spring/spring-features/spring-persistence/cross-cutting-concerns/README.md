# Cross-Cutting Concerns

## About

In the context of **JPA within Spring applications**, _cross-cutting concerns_ refer to functionalities that are not directly part of your domain model or business logic, but are critical to the **reliable, consistent, and maintainable** operation of your persistence layer. These concerns span across multiple layers and modules and are often handled declaratively through annotations or framework configuration.

In software architecture, most features follow the core flow: input → business logic → data access. However, some features "cut across" these layers and are required _regardless of what the application does_. These include:

* Logging
* Security (e.g., authentication/authorization)
* Transaction Management
* Caching
* Error Handling
* Auditing
* Concurrency Control
* Performance Monitoring
