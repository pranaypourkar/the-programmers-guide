# Concepts

## 1. Does reading a message automatically remove it from ActiveMQ?

In ActiveMQ, whether a message is removed after being read depends on the **acknowledgment mode** and the behavior of the **consumer**. Here's how it works:

#### **1. Acknowledgment Modes**

ActiveMQ uses acknowledgment modes to determine when a message can be safely removed from the queue. These are the key acknowledgment modes:

**a. AUTO\_ACKNOWLEDGE**

* **Default Behavior**:
  * Messages are automatically acknowledged when they are successfully delivered to a consumer.
  * Once acknowledged, the message is removed from the queue.
* Use case: Simplifies handling but less control over message processing.

**b. CLIENT\_ACKNOWLEDGE**

* **Behavior**:
  * The consumer explicitly acknowledges the message using `message.acknowledge()`.
  * Messages are not removed from the queue until acknowledged.
  * If the consumer fails to acknowledge, the message remains in the queue for redelivery.
* Use case: Useful for fine-grained control over message acknowledgment.

**c. DUPS\_OK\_ACKNOWLEDGE**

* **Behavior**:
  * Similar to `AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE`, but allows for duplicate messages if acknowledgment is delayed.
  * Messages are removed after being acknowledged.
* Use case: Suitable when duplicate messages are acceptable, like in certain log-processing scenarios.

**d. TRANSACTIONAL**

* **Behavior**:
  * Messages are acknowledged only when the transaction is committed.
  * If the transaction rolls back, the messages remain in the queue.
* Use case: Required for transactional message processing.

#### **2. Persistence and Redelivery**

* If the queue is **persistent** (default), unacknowledged messages are stored in the broker's disk storage and redelivered when the consumer reconnects or retries.
* If the queue is **non-persistent**, unacknowledged messages are lost if the broker restarts.

#### **3. Example Scenarios**

**a. Consumer Reads Message Successfully (Default: AUTO\_ACKNOWLEDGE)**

* Message is delivered to the consumer.
* Broker receives acknowledgment (auto).
* Message is removed from the queue.

**b. Consumer Reads but Fails to Process (CLIENT\_ACKNOWLEDGE)**

* Message is delivered but not acknowledged.
* Broker keeps the message in the queue for redelivery.

**c. Consumer in a Transaction**

* Message is delivered as part of a transaction.
* If the transaction commits, the message is removed.
* If the transaction rolls back, the message remains in the queue.

#### **4. Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) Handling**

If a message cannot be successfully delivered (e.g., after exceeding the maximum redelivery attempts), it is moved to a **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**. This ensures problematic messages are not lost but also do not block the queue.

## 2. Reduce memory in activemq.xml

To reduce memory usage in ActiveMQ, we can modify its configuration, including settings for the memory limits of destinations (queues/topics), as well as other parameters related to memory management. Here's how we can export the `activemq.xml` file, edit it, and apply changes to reduce memory usage.

#### Steps to Export and Edit `activemq.xml`:

1. **Locate the `activemq.xml` Configuration File**:
   * In Docker, the `activemq.xml` file is typically located in the `/opt/activemq/conf/` directory inside the container.
   * We can either copy this file from the container to our local machine or mount a local configuration file in the Docker container.
2. **Copy the `activemq.xml` Configuration File to Local Machine**:
   *   If we want to edit it locally, we can copy the `activemq.xml` file from the container to our local machine using `docker cp`:

       ```bash
       docker cp activemq:/opt/activemq/conf/activemq.xml ./activemq.xml
       ```
3. **Edit `activemq.xml` File**:
   * Once the `activemq.xml` file is on our local machine, open it in our favorite text editor (e.g., `nano`, `vim`, or a GUI-based editor).
   * Look for sections related to memory configuration. Here are some common parameters we can adjust to reduce memory usage:

#### Key Configurations to Adjust Memory Usage:

1.  **Memory Limits for Queues (Destination Policy)**:

    * We can adjust the memory limits for queues or topics to ensure that messages are not retained in memory for too long.
    * For example, set `memoryLimit` in the `<destinationPolicy>` section:

    ```xml
    <destinationPolicy>
        <policyMap>
            <policyEntries>
                <policyEntry queue=">" >
                    <!-- Set a memory limit for queues (in MB) -->
                    <memoryLimit>64mb</memoryLimit>
                </policyEntry>
                <policyEntry topic=">" >
                    <!-- Set a memory limit for topics (in MB) -->
                    <memoryLimit>64mb</memoryLimit>
                </policyEntry>
            </policyEntries>
        </policyMap>
    </destinationPolicy>
    ```

    This configuration ensures that queues and topics are limited to 64 MB of memory. When the memory limit is reached, ActiveMQ will start applying flow control, preventing producers from flooding the broker with messages.
2.  **Memory Limits for Broker**:

    * We can set a memory limit for the entire broker in the `<broker>` tag. This is helpful if we want to control the overall memory usage.

    ```xml
    <broker xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core"
            brokerName="localhost" dataDirectory="${activemq.data}">
        <!-- Set the memory limit for the broker -->
        <memoryUsage>
            <memoryLimit>512mb</memoryLimit>  <!-- Set total memory for broker -->
        </memoryUsage>
    </broker>
    ```
3.  **Reduce Message Size Limits**:

    * We can also reduce the size of individual messages being sent, which can help prevent high memory usage by large messages.

    ```xml
    <destinationPolicy>
        <policyMap>
            <policyEntries>
                <policyEntry queue=">" >
                    <!-- Set a maximum message size -->
                    <maxMessageSize>1000000</maxMessageSize>  <!-- 1 MB -->
                </policyEntry>
            </policyEntries>
        </policyMap>
    </destinationPolicy>
    ```
4.  **Producer Flow Control**:

    * ActiveMQ uses **Producer Flow Control** to prevent producers from overloading the broker by applying backpressure when memory limits are reached. We can enable or tweak this setting in the configuration:

    ```xml
    <broker xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core"
            brokerName="localhost" dataDirectory="${activemq.data}">
        <!-- Enable producer flow control -->
        <producerFlowControl>false</producerFlowControl>  <!-- Disable if needed -->
    </broker>
    ```

#### 4. **Mount the Edited `activemq.xml` Back to Docker**:

*   Once we've made our edits, we can either:

    *   Copy the modified `activemq.xml` back into the container using `docker cp`:

        ```bash
        bashCopyEditdocker cp ./activemq.xml activemq:/opt/activemq/conf/activemq.xml
        ```
    * Or, if we're using Docker Compose, we can mount the modified `activemq.xml` file directly to the container by adding a `volumes` section to our `docker-compose.yml`:

    ```yaml
    activemq:
      container_name: activemq
      image: symptoma/activemq:5.17.3
      privileged: true
      ports:
        - "61616:61616"
        - "8161:8161"
      healthcheck:
        test: /opt/activemq/bin/activemq query --objname type=Broker,brokerName=*,service=Health | grep Good
        interval: 10s
        timeout: 5s
        retries: 5
      volumes:
        - ./activemq.xml:/opt/activemq/conf/activemq.xml
    ```

5. **Restart ActiveMQ**:
   *   After applying the changes, restart the container to apply the new configuration:

       ```bash
       bashCopyEditdocker-compose down
       docker-compose up -d
       ```
6. **Monitor ActiveMQ Memory Usage**:
   * Check the ActiveMQ logs and web console to ensure that memory usage is now within the limits we've configured. We can monitor memory usage in the ActiveMQ Web Console at `http://localhost:8161` (default).

## 3 Throttling of Messages

In the context of **Message Queues (MQ)** like ActiveMQ, **throttling** refers to controlling the rate of message production or consumption to ensure system stability, optimal performance, and resource utilization. Throttling is commonly used to avoid overloading the broker, consumers, or producers, and to maintain consistent message flow.

### Throttling in MQ

1. **Producer Throttling:**
   * Controls the rate at which producers send messages to the broker.
   * Prevents flooding the broker when:
     * Producers send messages faster than consumers can process them.
     * The broker's memory, storage, or thread limits are exceeded.
   * **Example in ActiveMQ:**
     * When the broker detects that memory limits are nearing capacity, it can block or slow down producers using **Producer Flow Control**.
2. **Consumer Throttling:**
   * Controls the rate at which consumers retrieve messages from the broker.
   * Prevents overwhelming the consumer application when:
     * Consumers cannot process messages as fast as they are retrieved.
     * Downstream systems or databases are slow, creating a bottleneck.
   * **Implementation:**
     * Configuring a prefetch limit to control the number of messages delivered to a consumer at one time.
3. **Broker Throttling:**
   * Manages message flow at the broker level.
   * Ensures even distribution of resources across queues/topics and maintains stability under high load.
   * Techniques include:
     * Limiting memory/disk usage per destination.
     * Prioritizing specific queues/topics.
4. **Network Throttling:**
   * Limits the rate of message transfer between brokers in a distributed system.
   * Useful in scenarios involving geographically distributed brokers to prevent bandwidth exhaustion.

### Use Cases of Throttling

1. **Preventing Memory Overload:**
   * By slowing down producers when the broker memory reaches a certain threshold, throttling prevents OutOfMemoryErrors.
2. **Smoothing Traffic Spikes:**
   * Throttling evens out bursts of high message volume, ensuring consistent performance.
3. **Protecting Slow Consumers:**
   * If a consumer is slow, throttling prevents message backlogs that can lead to DLQ buildup or broker exhaustion.
4. **Adapting to System Limits:**
   * Throttling ensures that message rates align with the capacity of processing systems, databases, or network bandwidth.

### Throttling Configuration in ActiveMQ

**1. Producer Flow Control**

* Automatically throttles producers when the broker or destination memory limit is reached.
*   Configured in `activemq.xml`:

    ```xml
    <policyEntry queue=">" producerFlowControl="true" memoryLimit="100mb"/>
    ```
* Producers will block until memory is freed.

**2. Prefetch Limit (Consumer Throttling)**

* Controls how many messages are sent to a consumer at a time.
*   Configured using the `prefetchPolicy`:

    ```java
    ActiveMQConnectionFactory connectionFactory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory();
    connectionFactory.getPrefetchPolicy().setQueuePrefetch(10);
    ```

**3. Network Throttling**

*   Limit network bandwidth for message replication between brokers:

    ```xml
    <networkConnector name="bridge" uri="tcp://other-broker:61616" conduitSubscriptions="true">
        <networkTTL>2</networkTTL>
        <rateLimit>1000</rateLimit> <!-- Messages/sec -->
    </networkConnector>
    ```

### Benefits of Throttling

* Prevents **resource exhaustion** (CPU, memory, disk, bandwidth).
* Ensures **fair resource allocation** across queues/topics.
* Helps maintain **system stability** under varying loads.
* Protects downstream systems from **overloading** due to sudden message bursts.

## **Synchronous vs Asynchronous Message Publishing**

When publishing messages in a messaging system like ActiveMQ (or any message broker), the choice between **synchronous** and **asynchronous** modes impacts how our application behaves, especially in terms of performance, reliability, and responsiveness.

### **1. Synchronous Message Publishing**

* **How It Works:**
  * The publisher sends a message to the broker and waits for an acknowledgment or response before proceeding.
  * The acknowledgment can confirm that:
    * The broker has received the message.
    * The message is persisted (if persistence is enabled).
    * The message is ready for delivery to consumers.
* **Advantages:**
  1. **Reliability:**
     * Guarantees that the message has been delivered to the broker before continuing.
  2. **Error Handling:**
     * Easier to handle errors as the sender knows immediately if the message was not successfully published.
  3. **Order Guarantee:**
     * Messages are sent in strict sequence since the publisher waits for one message to complete before sending the next.
* **Disadvantages:**
  1. **Latency:**
     * Slower because the publisher waits for acknowledgment.
  2. **Scalability:**
     * Limited throughput, as the publisher can only send one message at a time per thread.
  3. **Blocking:**
     * Blocks the publishing thread, potentially causing delays in high-load scenarios.

### **2. Asynchronous Message Publishing**

* **How It Works:**
  * The publisher sends a message to the broker without waiting for acknowledgment.
  * The message is added to a queue (often in memory) for background transmission to the broker.
  * Publishing and acknowledgment are decoupled.
* **Advantages:**
  1. **High Throughput:**
     * The publisher can send multiple messages without waiting for responses.
  2. **Non-Blocking:**
     * The publishing thread is free to perform other tasks immediately after sending.
  3. **Scalability:**
     * Suitable for handling large volumes of messages and high traffic.
* **Disadvantages:**
  1. **Error Handling Complexity:**
     * If the broker is unavailable, messages may be lost unless explicitly handled (e.g., retries, buffering).
  2. **Reliability Trade-offs:**
     * The sender doesn’t know immediately whether the broker has successfully received the message.
  3. **Order Guarantee:**
     * Order of messages may not be strictly preserved, depending on implementation.

### **3. Use Cases**

**Synchronous Publishing**

* **Scenarios:**
  * When message reliability is critical (e.g., financial transactions).
  * When order and strict processing are essential.
  * Low-volume systems where latency is not a concern.
*   **Example:**

    ```java
    producer.send(message);  // Blocks until acknowledgment is received
    ```

**Asynchronous Publishing**

* **Scenarios:**
  * High-throughput systems requiring rapid message dispatch.
  * Non-critical operations where occasional message loss is acceptable.
  * Applications using retry mechanisms or dead-letter queues to handle failures.
*   **Example:**

    ```java
    producer.send(message, new CompletionListener() {
        @Override
        public void onCompletion(Message message) {
            // Message successfully delivered
        }

        @Override
        public void onException(Message message, Exception exception) {
            // Handle failure
        }
    });
    ```
