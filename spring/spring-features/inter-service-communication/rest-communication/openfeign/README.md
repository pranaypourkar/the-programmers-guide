# 3. OpenFeign

## About

**Feign Client** is a declarative HTTP client developed by Netflix and integrated into the Spring Cloud ecosystem. It allows developers to write HTTP clients for REST APIs in a simple, interface-based way without needing to manually use `RestTemplate` or `WebClient`.

Instead of writing boilerplate code to construct HTTP requests, parse responses, and handle errors, Feign lets us define a Java interface, annotate it with mapping information, and Spring Cloud automatically provides the implementation under the hood.

It integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot and other Spring Cloud modules like Eureka (for service discovery), Ribbon (for load balancing now replaced by Spring Cloud LoadBalancer), and Resilience4j (for circuit breakers and retries).

## When & Why it was Introduced ? <a href="#when-and-why-it-was-introduced" id="when-and-why-it-was-introduced"></a>

Feign was originally developed as part of the **Netflix OSS stack**, intended to simplify HTTP client development for internal service communication. It gained popularity as part of **Spring Cloud Netflix**, and later became a core piece of **Spring Cloud OpenFeign** (an improved integration for Spring Boot projects).

* **Feign (Netflix OSS)**: Introduced as an open-source declarative HTTP client.
* **Spring Cloud Netflix Feign**: Integrated into Spring Cloud for microservices-based systems.
* **Spring Cloud OpenFeign** (modern variant): Maintained by the Spring team to provide richer Spring-style features and eliminate direct dependency on Netflix's deprecated stack.

#### **Why Was It Introduced ?**

Before Feign, developers often relied on low-level tools like `RestTemplate` to call REST services. This involved:

* Manually constructing URLs.
* Handling headers, serialization/deserialization.
* Managing exceptions, timeouts, and retries.

This became repetitive and error-prone — especially in **microservices** architectures where services frequently call each other.

**The goals behind Feign's introduction were:**

## Typical Usage Scenario <a href="#typical-usage-scenario" id="typical-usage-scenario"></a>

In a typical enterprise system, microservices often need to talk to each other to retrieve or manipulate shared domain data. Let’s consider a real-world example:

> **Scenario:** A `payment-service` needs to fetch user account details from `account-service`.

Using traditional HTTP clients like `RestTemplate` or even `WebClient`, developers have to write boilerplate code—constructing URLs, encoding parameters, configuring headers, handling serialization, and more.

With **Feign Client**, this can be dramatically simplified. All we need is an interface:

```java
@FeignClient(name = "account-service")
public interface AccountClient {
    @GetMapping("/accounts/{id}")
    AccountResponse getAccountById(@PathVariable("id") Long id);
}
```

And then inject it wherever needed:

```java
@Autowired
private AccountClient accountClient;

public PaymentResponse getPaymentDetails(Long accountId) {
    AccountResponse account = accountClient.getAccountById(accountId);
    // use account details in payment processing
}
```

## When to Use OpenFeign ?

OpenFeign is especially useful in distributed systems where microservices need to communicate over HTTP or REST. It shines in scenarios that benefit from **declarative client interfaces**, **tight Spring Cloud integration**, and **clean abstraction** over remote API calls.

## When Not to Use OpenFeign ?

While OpenFeign simplifies REST client creation in many scenarios, there are valid reasons to **avoid** or **limit** its usage in complex or high-performance systems.

<table data-header-hidden data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="194.109375"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Situation</strong></td><td><strong>Why Feign May Not Be the Right Choice</strong></td></tr><tr><td>High-Throughput, Low-Latency Systems</td><td>Feign is synchronous and blocking by default. For non-blocking, reactive needs, WebClient is better suited.</td></tr><tr><td>We Need Non-Blocking Communication</td><td>Feign (with default Spring Cloud setup) uses blocking I/O. In reactive applications, especially with WebFlux, use <code>WebClient</code> instead.</td></tr><tr><td>Large and Evolving APIs</td><td>Managing Feign interfaces for large APIs can become tedious and error-prone. OpenAPI-generated clients may provide better maintainability and type-safety.</td></tr><tr><td>We Prefer Explicit Configuration</td><td>Feign hides many details. For fine-grained control over headers, timeouts, error handling, and message converters, <code>RestTemplate</code> or <code>WebClient</code> offer more visibility.</td></tr><tr><td>We Want to Avoid Reflection and Proxy Overhead</td><td>Feign heavily relies on proxies and reflection which can impact performance or complicate debugging.</td></tr><tr><td>Lack of Built-in Retry or Circuit Breaking</td><td>Feign requires external integrations (Resilience4j, RetryTemplate, etc.) for retries and fallbacks. If misconfigured, it can silently fail or retry endlessly.</td></tr><tr><td>Client Versioning or Backward Compatibility</td><td>If the server API changes frequently, we may need runtime flexibility or OpenAPI-based version management over static Feign contracts.</td></tr><tr><td>Security-Sensitive or Advanced Auth Scenarios</td><td>Adding custom auth mechanisms (like per-request dynamic tokens, encryption, or custom headers) may require advanced customization that is simpler in other tools.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
