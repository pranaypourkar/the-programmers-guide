# Terminology

**Plaintext:** The original, readable data or message.

**Ciphertext**: The encrypted version of the plaintext, rendered unreadable without the proper key.

**Encryption**: The process of converting plaintext into ciphertext using an algorithm and a key.

**Decryption**: The reverse process, transforming ciphertext back into plaintext using the corresponding key.

**Keys**: A key is a piece of information that determines the output of a cryptographic algorithm. Keys are crucial in both encryption and decryption processes.

**Algorithms**: Cryptographic algorithms are mathematical procedures used for encryption and decryption. They are designed to be computationally difficult to reverse without the key.

**Hash Function:** Converts input data into a fixed-size string of characters, typically a digest unique to each unique input, used for data integrity verification.&#x20;

**Digital Signature:** A method to verify the authenticity and integrity of a message, software, or digital document using asymmetric cryptography.&#x20;

**Confidentiality**: Ensures that information is accessible only to those authorized to access it, typically achieved through encryption.&#x20;

**Integrity**: Ensures that information has not been altered in an unauthorized manner, often achieved through hashing and digital signatures.&#x20;

**Authentication**: Confirms the identity of the parties involved in communication, achieved through digital certificates and public key infrastructure (PKI).&#x20;

**Non-repudiation**: Ensures that a party cannot deny the authenticity of their signature on a document or a message they sent, achieved through digital signatures.&#x20;

**Public Key**: Used in asymmetric encryption, it is shared openly to enable others to encrypt data or verify a digital signature.&#x20;

**Private Key**: Used in asymmetric encryption, it is kept secret and used to decrypt data or create a digital signature.&#x20;

**Certificate Authority (CA)**: An entity that issues digital certificates, which verify the ownership of a public key.&#x20;

**Digital Certificate**: An electronic document that uses a digital signature to bind a public key with an identity, such as a person or organization.&#x20;

**Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)**: A protocol for establishing authenticated and encrypted links between networked computers.&#x20;

**Transport Layer Security (TLS)**: A successor to SSL, providing secure communication over a computer network.&#x20;

**Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**: A widely used symmetric encryption algorithm known for its strength and efficiency.&#x20;

**Data Encryption Standard (DES)**: An older symmetric encryption algorithm, now considered insecure due to its small key size.&#x20;

**Triple DES (3DES)**: An enhancement of DES that applies the encryption process three times with different keys for improved security.&#x20;

**Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)**: A popular asymmetric encryption algorithm used for secure data transmission.&#x20;

**Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**: An asymmetric encryption algorithm known for its efficiency and security, using smaller key sizes compared to RSA.&#x20;

**Pretty Good Privacy (PGP**): An encryption program providing cryptographic privacy and authentication, commonly used for securing email communication.&#x20;

**Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)**: A specific type of message authentication code (MAC) involving a cryptographic hash function and a secret key.&#x20;

**Key Management**: The process of generating, distributing, storing, and revoking encryption keys, crucial for the security of encryption systems.&#x20;

**Quantum Cryptography**: A type of cryptography based on the principles of quantum mechanics, promising enhanced security.&#x20;

**Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Developing cryptographic algorithms resistant to quantum computing attacks.&#x20;

**Homomorphic Encryption**: Allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it, ensuring data privacy and security.&#x20;

**Blockchain**: A decentralized digital ledger that uses cryptographic techniques to secure and verify transactions.&#x20;

**Tokenization**: The process of replacing sensitive data with unique identification symbols that retain essential information without compromising security.
