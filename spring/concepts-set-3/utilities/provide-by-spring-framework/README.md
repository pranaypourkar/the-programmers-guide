# Provide by Spring framework

Spring Framework utilities provide a variety of functionalities that can be readily used without need of adding any external libraries. It is included in the core Spring Framework dependency, which is commonly referred to as `spring-core`

**Considerations:**

* These utilities are primarily designed for internal Spring framework use or to complement Spring functionalities. If more extensive functionalities or libraries is needed that fall outside the scope of Spring's core utilities, consider exploring other options like Guava, Lombok, etc.
* Prioritize built-in Spring utilities and Java core utilities for efficiency and adherence to Spring's ecosystem.
* Evaluate the trade-offs carefully before introducing external dependencies, especially if they add significant complexity or maintenance overhead.
