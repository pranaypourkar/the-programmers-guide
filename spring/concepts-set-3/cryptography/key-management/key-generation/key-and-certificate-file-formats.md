# Key & Certificate File Formats

Cryptographic keys and certificates are stored in various formats, each serving different purposes and environments.

## Key File Formats

### **PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail)**

PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail) format is a Base64 encoded ASCII format that represents binary data (such as cryptographic keys and certificates) in a text-based format. It includes header and footer lines that delineate the beginning and end of the encoded data. PEM format is widely used due to its compatibility with many systems and ease of human readability.

* **Extension**: `.pem`, `.key`, `.crt`, `.cer`
* **Description**: Base64 encoded DER format with header and footer lines.
* **Headers**:
  * Private Key: `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----`
  * Public Key: `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----`
  * RSA Private Key: `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`
  * EC Private Key: `-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----`
* **Usage**: Widely used for storing private keys, public keys, and certificates in text format. Compatible with many systems and applications.

{% hint style="info" %}
**.pem**: Generic extension used for any PEM-encoded file, whether it's a private key, public key, or certificate.

**.key**: Often used to denote PEM-encoded private keys. For example, `private.key` could contain a PEM-encoded RSA private key.

**.crt** or **.cer**: Commonly used for PEM-encoded certificates. For instance, `server.crt` could contain a PEM-encoded SSL/TLS server certificate.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
A `.key` file, when it contains a symmetric key like an AES key, is typically in binary format. This binary format is not human-readable and cannot be meaningfully viewed or edited with a text editor. However, for certain types of keys (such as RSA private keys or certificates), a `.key` file might be in a PEM format, which is Base64-encoded and can be viewed with a text editor.

* **Formats**: PEM for private keys and certificates; PKCS#12 for storing both keys and certificates.
* **Description**: SSL/TLS certificates encrypt data between the client and server, preventing eavesdropping and tampering.
* **Example**:
  *   **Apache**: Uses PEM format for SSL/TLS certificates.

      ```bash
      SSLCertificateFile /path/to/certificate.crt
      SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/private.key
      SSLCertificateChainFile /path/to/ca_bundle.crt
      ```
  *   **Nginx**: Also uses PEM format.

      ```bash
      server {
          listen 443 ssl;
          ssl_certificate /path/to/certificate.crt;
          ssl_certificate_key /path/to/private.key;
          ssl_trusted_certificate /path/to/ca_bundle.crt;
      }
      ```
  *   **IIS**: Uses PKCS#12 format.

      ```powershell
      Import-PfxCertificate -FilePath "C:\path\to\certificate.pfx" -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\My
      ```

{% hint style="info" %}
The keys and certificates are typically stored in PEM format, even though the file extensions might be `.key` for private keys and `.crt` for certificates.&#x20;

* **Example**:
  *   **Generate SSH Keys**:

      ```bash
      ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
      ```
  *   **Copy Public Key to Server**:

      ```bash
      ssh-copy-id user@server
      ```
  *   **Use SSH Key for Login**:

      ```bash
      ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa user@server
      ```

### **Mobile Devices**

  * **Internal Certificate Authority (CA)**: Issue and manage certificates within the organization.
    *   **Generate Root CA Certificate**:

        ```bash
        openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out rootCA.key -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096
        openssl req -x509 -new -key rootCA.key -days 3650 -out rootCA.crt -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Organization/OU=Org Unit/CN=Root CA"
        ```
    *   **Issue Certificates**:

        ```bash
        openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out server.key -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
        openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Organization/OU=Org Unit/CN=server.example.com"
        openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA rootCA.crt -CAkey rootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 365
        ```

### **VPN Connections**

**Usage**: Secure remote access to networks.

* **Formats**: PKCS#12 for storing private keys and certificates; PEM for public certificates.
* **Description**: VPNs use certificates to authenticate clients and servers, ensuring secure communication channels.
* **Example**:
  * **OpenVPN**: Uses PEM format for keys and certificates.
    *   **Server Configuration**:

        ```bash
        ca ca.crt
        cert server.crt
        key server.key
        ```
    *   **Client Configuration**:

        ```bash
        eca ca.crt
        cert client.crt
        key client.key
        ```

## Best Practices:

* **Consistency**: Stick to standard conventions for file extensions (`*.key` for private keys, `*.crt` or `*.cer` for certificates) to maintain clarity and compatibility.
* **Verification**: Always verify the contents of files to ensure they are correctly encoded in PEM format, regardless of the extension.
* **Documentation**: Document file types and their contents clearly to facilitate maintenance and troubleshooting.
