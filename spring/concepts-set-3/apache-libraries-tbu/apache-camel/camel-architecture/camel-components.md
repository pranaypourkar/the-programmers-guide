# Camel Components

## About

In Apache Camel, components are essential building blocks that facilitate communication with various technologies, protocols, APIs, and services. Each component represents a technology-specific connector that allows Camel routes to interact with external systems. Components abstract the underlying complexity of a technology or protocol, making it easier for developers to use them in Camel routes.

## Key Aspects of Camel Components

### **Definition**

* A component in Apache Camel is a factory that creates and configures endpoints. Each component supports one or more endpoint types, depending on the nature of the technology or protocol it represents.
* For example:
  * The **File** component provides endpoints to interact with file systems.
  * The **JMS** component provides endpoints to work with messaging systems like ActiveMQ or RabbitMQ.
  * The **HTTP** component provides endpoints for making HTTP requests.

### **Component Structure**

* A component is identified by its URI scheme, which precedes the colon (e.g., `file:` or `jms:`). Camel identifies the right component by parsing the URI scheme.
* After the scheme, the URI may contain information such as file paths, server addresses, queue names, and additional options.

Example:

```java
from("file:inputDirectory?noop=true").to("jms:queue:orderQueue");
```

### **Types of Components**

Components can be broadly categorized based on their functionality or the type of technology they integrate with:

* **File-based Components**: Used for working with file systems and file transfers.
  * `file`, `ftp`, `sftp`
* **Messaging Components**: Used to interact with messaging systems, such as message brokers or event buses.
  * `jms`, `kafka`, `rabbitmq`
* **HTTP and Web Components**: Used to interact with web services, APIs, or to serve web content.
  * `http`, `jetty`, `servlet`, `rest`
* **Database Components**: Used to interact with databases and perform SQL operations.
  * `jdbc`, `jpa`, `sql`
* **Cloud Components**: Used for cloud-native integration, working with cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
  * `aws-s3`, `google-pubsub`, `azure-storage-blob`
* **Timer and Scheduling Components**: Used for scheduling events or generating periodic messages.
  * `timer`, `quartz`, `cron`
* **Integration Patterns Components**: Components that support various integration patterns such as content-based routing, filtering, and more.
  * `direct`, `seda`, `vm`

### **Component Options**

* Each component typically has a set of configurable options that can be set in the URI. These options may include things like polling intervals, buffer sizes, security credentials, timeouts, etc.
*   Example with options:

    ```java
    from("ftp://server/folder?username=user&password=secret&binary=true&delay=5000")
    .to("file:outputFolder");
    ```

    * `username=user`: Specifies the FTP username.
    * `binary=true`: Configures the transfer mode to binary.
    * `delay=5000`: Specifies a 5-second polling interval.

### **Component Lifecycle**

* Components are instantiated when the **CamelContext** is started. They can be reused across multiple routes, and Camel manages their lifecycle, ensuring they are properly started and stopped with the CamelContext.

### **Built-in and Custom Components**

* Camel comes with a vast array of **built-in components** that support a wide variety of protocols, APIs, and technologies (e.g., JMS, FTP, Kafka, HTTP, SQL).
* In addition to built-in components, developers can create **custom components** if they need to integrate Camel with proprietary or uncommon systems.

Example of using a built-in component:

```java
from("jms:queue:inputQueue").to("file:outputFolder");
```

Custom components typically extend `org.apache.camel.Component` and can be registered with CamelContext.

### **Commonly Used Camel Components**

*   **File Component**: Handles reading from and writing to files and directories.

    ```java
    from("file:input").to("file:output");
    ```
*   **JMS Component**: Integrates with message brokers such as ActiveMQ or RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging.

    ```java
    from("jms:queue:inputQueue").to("file:output");
    ```
*   **HTTP Component**: Used to send HTTP requests and consume HTTP services.

    ```java
    from("http://api.example.com/orders").to("log:response");
    ```
*   **Kafka Component**: Enables interaction with Apache Kafka for streaming and messaging.

    ```java
    from("kafka:my-topic").to("log:received");
    ```
*   **SQL Component**: Allows SQL queries to be executed against a relational database.

    ```java
    from("sql:select * from orders where status='NEW'").to("jms:queue:newOrders");
    ```
*   **Timer Component**: Triggers a route at regular intervals.

    ```java
    from("timer://heartbeat?period=10000").to("log:heartbeat");
    ```

### **Component Configuration**

* Components can be configured globally in the `CamelContext` or within specific routes.

**Global configuration** example in Spring XML:

```xml
<bean id="jms" class="org.apache.camel.component.jms.JmsComponent">
    <property name="connectionFactory" ref="myConnectionFactory"/>
</bean>
```

**In-route configuration** example:

```java
from("file:input?delete=true").to("file:output?fileExist=Append");
```

* This example shows file endpoint-specific options, where `delete=true` deletes the file after processing, and `fileExist=Append` appends to the existing file if it exists.

### **Creating Custom Components**

* While Camel provides a vast library of built-in components, it also offers a flexible framework for creating **custom components** for specific use cases.
* A custom component typically extends `org.apache.camel.Component` and defines how endpoints are created and how they interact with external systems.
* Custom components can be registered programmatically in CamelContext or as Spring beans.

### **Component Reuse and Flexibility**

* One of Camelâ€™s strengths is the ability to reuse components across multiple routes or within different parts of an application. This makes Camel flexible and easy to extend when integrating various systems.
* For example, the **File Component** can be reused in multiple routes to handle file input/output in different directories or with different options.

### **Component Auto-discovery**

* Camel provides **auto-discovery** for components using its ServiceLoader. Components can be automatically loaded and registered by placing them in the correct directory (e.g., `META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/component`).
