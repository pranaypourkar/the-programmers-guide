# Core Concepts

## About

This section focuses on the fundamental principles and mechanisms that form the foundation of the entire Spring Framework. Before diving into advanced modules like AOP, Security, or Data Access, it's essential to understand how Spring manages objects, configurations, environments, and behaviors under the hood.

This section explains how Spring works internally, covering topics like:

* The core container and bean lifecycle
* Dependency injection and Inversion of Control (IoC)
* Profiles to manage environment-specific configurations
* The role of annotations in defining behavior and wiring components

These are the **building blocks** that power every Spring application from a basic REST API to complex enterprise-level systems.

## Why This Section Matters ?

Understanding core concepts allows us to:

* Use Spring more effectively and confidently
* Debug unexpected behavior with clarity
* Customize application behavior through configuration, not code
* Avoid misusing Spring features or writing unnecessary boilerplate

If we only rely on Spring Boot auto-configuration without understanding the core ideas, we may struggle when customization or deeper control is needed.
