# Commonly Used Annotations

## About

Spring Framework provides a rich set of annotations that reduce boilerplate code and make configuration, dependency injection, request mapping, and many other aspects of application development more declarative and expressive.

This section groups together the annotations that developers frequently interact with while building Spring Boot applications across different layers of the application â€” including configuration, web, service, data access, and Spring Boot-specific behavior.
