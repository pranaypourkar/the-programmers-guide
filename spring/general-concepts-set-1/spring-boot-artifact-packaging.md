# Spring Boot Artifact Packaging

## About

Spring Boot artifact packaging refers to the process of bundling our Spring Boot application into a deployable format. This packaging ensures that our application can be easily deployed and run on various environments without requiring additional setup or configuration. Spring Boot provides multiple options for packaging artifacts (such as JARs and WARs) to simplify deployment. The packaging mode chosen depends on the type of application (standalone or traditional web app) and the intended deployment environment.

## Most common types of Packaging Options

* **JAR (Java Application Archive)**: By default, Spring Boot packages applications as executable JARs. An executable JAR includes the application's code, dependencies, and an embedded servlet container (such as Tomcat or Jetty), enabling us to run the application with a simple `java -jar` command.
* **WAR (Web Application  Archive)**: Spring Boot can also package applications as traditional WAR files. These WAR files are deployable to external servlet containers (such as Tomcat, Jetty, or WildFly). WAR packaging is useful when deploying Spring Boot applications in environments where a servlet container is already provided by the infrastructure
* **EAR (Enterprise Application Archive):** This packaging format is used for deploying large-scale enterprise applications that consist of multiple modules, such as EJBs, web applications, and connectors. EAR files include multiple modules, each packaged as a JAR or WAR file. They are suitable for complex applications with multiple components that need to be deployed together.
* **Executable JAR:** This is a special type of JAR file that can be executed directly from the command line without requiring the `java -jar` command. It includes a native launcher that allows the application to be run on different operating systems without requiring a Java installation. Executable JAR files are convenient for distributing our application to users who may not have Java installed.

## JAR Packaging

### 1. What is a JAR File?

* A **JAR** is a compressed archive that can contain Java classes, libraries, images, and resources necessary for a Java application to run.
* It uses the same format as a **ZIP** file but has additional metadata for Java applications.
* JAR files are platform-independent and allow Java applications to be distributed and deployed easily.

{% hint style="info" %}
#### **Compression in JAR Files**

* JAR files use ZIP compression to reduce the size of the archive. This compression helps in faster transmission and better storage utilization.
* The compression is automatically handled when we create a JAR using tools like `jar` or build systems like Maven or Gradle.
{% endhint %}

### **2.** Types of JAR Files

* **Library JAR**: A non-executable JAR that contains code (typically reusable libraries) without a `Main-Class` entry.
* **Executable JAR**: Contains a `Main-Class` entry in its `MANIFEST.MF` file, which allows the JAR to be executed with `java -jar`.
* **Runnable JAR**: A type of executable JAR but with dependencies packed inside (a "fat JAR").

### 3. Typical JAR File

A Typical JAR file contains:

* **Java Class Files**: Compiled `.class` files from the Java source code.
* **Resources**: Non-code resources such as images, configuration files, property files, etc.
* **Manifest File (`META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`)**: A special file that contains metadata about the JAR, such as the main class to be executed, versioning information, and other properties.

{% hint style="info" %}
A typical JAR file usually does not include its third-party dependencies. It only contains our compiled class files and resources. External libraries (dependencies) must be included in the classpath separately when running the application
{% endhint %}

#### **Typical JAR file structure**

```
my-application.jar
|-- META-INF/
    |-- MANIFEST.MF  # Contains metadata
|-- com/
    |-- myapp/
        |-- Main.class  # Java class files
|-- resources/
    |-- config.properties  # Resources used by the application
```

#### **-> Manifest File (`MANIFEST.MF`)**

The **MANIFEST.MF** file located in the `META-INF` directory is critical for providing meta-information about the JAR file. It follows a key-value format and can contain:

*   **Version Information**: Version of the manifest and the JAR file.

    ```
    Manifest-Version: 1.0
    ```
* **Main-Class**: Specifies the entry point (the class containing the `main()` method) of the application when the JAR is executable.

```
Main-Class: com.myapp.Main
```

* **Class-Path**: Specifies external libraries or JAR files required for the application to run.

```
Class-Path: lib/dependency1.jar lib/dependency2.jar
```

Example `MANIFEST.MF`:

```
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Main-Class: com.example.Main
Class-Path: lib/library1.jar lib/library2.jar
```

**-> `com/myapp/` (or equivalent package structure)**

* This is where all our compiled **class files** are stored. The directory structure reflects the package hierarchy of our Java classes.
*   Example:

    ```
    com/myapp/
      MainApplication.class
      SomeOtherClass.class
    ```

**->** **`resources/`** (or other resource directories)

* Non-class files such as properties files, images, or XML configuration files are often included here.
* These files might be configuration files or other resources that our application needs to access at runtime.
*   Example:

    ```
    resources/
      config.properties
      messages.properties
    ```

#### **Running a JAR**

* If the manifest specifies a `Main-Class`, we can run the JAR with:

```
java -jar my-application.jar
```

* Otherwise, we must manually specify the classpath and main class to run:

```
java -cp my-application.jar com.example.myapp.MainApplication
```

### **4. Spring Boot JAR File**

In addition to a typical JAR file, a Spring Boot JAR has:

* **Embedded Dependencies**: All third-party libraries are included in `BOOT-INF/lib`, making it a **fat JAR**. This eliminates the need for an external dependency manager during runtime.
* **Custom Class Loader**: Spring Boot uses a custom class loader (from the `org.springframework.boot.loader` package) to load classes from `BOOT-INF/classes` and `BOOT-INF/lib` correctly.
* **Embedded Server**: If we're building a Spring Boot web application, the JAR file will contain an embedded web server (like Tomcat or Jetty) inside the `BOOT-INF/lib` directory, allowing the application to run standalone without external servers.

#### **Spring Boot JAR file structure**

```
sample-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT/
  |-- BOOT-INF/
      |-- classes/
      |-- lib/
  |-- META-INF/
      |-- maven/org.example/sample-project/
  |-- org/springframework/boot/loader/
```

#### -> **`BOOT-INF/` Directory**

This is where Spring Boot segregates the applicationâ€™s compiled classes and its dependencies.

&#x20;   **--- `BOOT-INF/classes/`**:

* Contains our applicationâ€™s compiled `.class` files and other resources (e.g., properties or YAML files).
*   For example:

    ```
    BOOT-INF/classes/com/example/demo/
      MainApplication.class
      OtherClass.class
    ```

&#x20;   **--- `BOOT-INF/lib/`**:

* Contains all the third-party dependencies packaged within our Spring Boot application. These are the libraries our application needs to run, based on what we declared in`pom.xml` or `build.gradle`.
* Each library is stored as a separate JAR file.
*   For example:

    ```
    BOOT-INF/lib/spring-boot-starter-web-2.7.0.jar
    BOOT-INF/lib/commons-lang3-3.12.0.jar
    ```

#### **-> `META-INF/` Directory**

This directory contains metadata about our application, typical in Java archive files.

&#x20;   **--- `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`**:

* The manifest file contains metadata such as the entry point of our Spring Boot application and the version of Spring Boot.
*   Example content:

    ```
    Manifest-Version: 1.0
    Created-By: Maven JAR Plugin 3.3.0
    Build-Jdk-Spec: 22
    Implementation-Title: sample-project
    Implementation-Version: 1.0-SNAPSHOT
    Main-Class: org.springframework.boot.loader.JarLauncher
    Start-Class: org.example.Application
    Spring-Boot-Version: 3.1.10
    Spring-Boot-Classes: BOOT-INF/classes/
    Spring-Boot-Lib: BOOT-INF/lib/
    Spring-Boot-Classpath-Index: BOOT-INF/classpath.idx
    Spring-Boot-Layers-Index: BOOT-INF/layers.idx
    ```
* **Main-Class**: Specifies the class that will bootstrap our Spring Boot application, typically `JarLauncher`.
* **Start-Class**: Our applicationâ€™s entry point with the `main()` method (`MainApplication` in this case)

&#x20;   **--- `META-INF/maven/org.example/sample-project/`**:

* This subdirectory contains files generated by Maven during the build process:
  * **`pom.xml`**: The projectâ€™s Maven `pom.xml` file. It defines the projectâ€™s dependencies and configuration.
  * **`pom.properties`**: This file contains information such as the group ID, artifact ID, version, and other Maven-related metadata.
*   Example structure:

    ```
    META-INF/maven/org.example/sample-project/
      pom.xml
      pom.properties
    ```

&#x20;**-> `org/springframework/boot/loader/` Directory**

This directory is part of the Spring Boot **Loader**. It contains the classes that manage launching our Spring Boot application.

* **Loader Classes**:
  * The classes here, such as `JarLauncher`, `WarLauncher`, and `PropertiesLauncher`, handle the custom class loading and the execution of our Spring Boot JAR file.
  * These classes are responsible for reading classes from `BOOT-INF/classes` and `BOOT-INF/lib` and ensuring that they are available to the application.
  * Key classes:
    * **`JarLauncher`**: Handles launching the Spring Boot JAR.
    * **`WarLauncher`**: Used if the application is packaged as a WAR (not typical for a JAR).
    * **`PropertiesLauncher`**: Enables launching based on configuration properties.

Example:

```
org/springframework/boot/loader/
  JarLauncher.class
  WarLauncher.class
  PropertiesLauncher.class
```

### 5. **How Spring Boot Fat JAR Works?**

When we run a Spring Boot JAR using `java -jar sample-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`, the following process happens:

1. **Spring Boot Loader**: The `JarLauncher` (specified in the `MANIFEST.MF`) starts execution.
2. **Class Loading**: The launcher sets up a custom class loader that loads classes from `BOOT-INF/classes` (our applicationâ€™s classes) and `BOOT-INF/lib` (our dependencies).
3. **Application Startup**: The `Start-Class` (our main application class, specified in the manifest) is then located and executed, starting the Spring Boot application.
4. **Embedded Server**: If itâ€™s a web application, the embedded web server (e.g., Tomcat) is started, and the application becomes accessible via the configured port (default: `8080`).

### **6. Creating a JAR File**

#### **a. Using the JDK `jar` Tool**

The JDK provides a `jar` command to create, view, or extract JAR files.

**-> Creating a JAR**: If we have compiled class files in the `com/example` directory:

```
jar cvf myapp.jar -C ./com .    
```

* `c`: Create a new JAR file.
* `v`: Verbose output to show the files being added.
* `f`: Output the result to a file (e.g., `myapp.jar`).
* `-C`: Change to the specified directory (`./com`) before adding files.

**-> Adding a Manifest File**: We can include a custom `MANIFEST.MF` file using:

```
jar cvfm myapp.jar MANIFEST.MF -C ./com .
```

#### **b. Using Build Tools**

*   **Maven**: Maven simplifies the process of building JAR files using the `maven-jar-plugin`:

    ```
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-jar-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.2.0</version>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
    ```

### **7. Security in JAR Files**

**a. Signing JAR Files**

We can sign a JAR file to ensure its authenticity and integrity. Signing is typically used when distributing JARs over the web.

* **Sign JAR**: Use the `jarsigner` tool to sign a JAR file.

```
jarsigner -keystore mykeystore -signedjar signed.jar myapp.jar alias_name
```

**b. Verifying Signed JARs**

We can verify the signature of a JAR file using:

```
jarsigner -verify signed.jar
```

### **8. Multi-Release JARs**

Introduced in Java 9, **multi-release JARs** allow different class versions to be packaged for different Java runtime environments. This enables backward compatibility while taking advantage of newer Java features.

* **Structure of a multi-release JAR**:

```
META-INF/versions/9/com/example/MyClass.class
META-INF/versions/11/com/example/MyClass.class
```

The JVM automatically selects the appropriate class version based on the runtime environment.
