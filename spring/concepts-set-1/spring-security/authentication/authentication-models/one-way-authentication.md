# One-Way Authentication

## About

One-way authentication is a security model where **only one party (typically the client)** verifies the identity of the other party (usually the server). The client ensures that it is communicating with a legitimate and trusted server, but the server does not authenticate the client in return.

This authentication model is commonly used in **web applications, API communications, and secure network connections**, where the client needs assurance that it is interacting with the correct server.

## **How One-Way Authentication Works ?**

The process of one-way authentication typically follows these steps:

1. **Client Requests Access**
   * The client (user or application) sends a request to the server to establish a secure connection.
2. **Server Presents Credentials**
   * The server provides **authentication credentials**, such as a **digital certificate** or **password**, to prove its legitimacy.
3. **Client Verifies Server Identity**
   * The client checks the server’s credentials against **trusted authorities** (e.g., a Certificate Authority in SSL/TLS).
4. **Secure Connection Established**
   * If the server's credentials are valid, the client trusts the server and proceeds with communication.
   * If the verification fails, the connection is **rejected** to prevent communication with an untrusted entity.

## **Common Methods of One-Way Authentication**

### **1. Username & Password Authentication**

* The client provides a username and password to the server.
* The server verifies the credentials and grants access.
* The **server is authenticated**, but the client’s identity is not verified.

### **2. SSL/TLS Certificate Authentication (HTTPS)**

* The server presents an **SSL/TLS certificate** to the client.
* The certificate is verified using a **Certificate Authority (CA)**.
* If valid, the client trusts the server and establishes a **secure connection** (e.g., HTTPS websites).

### **3. API Key Authentication**

* Clients include an **API key** in requests to access a server or service.
* The server verifies the API key before granting access.
* The client trusts the server’s identity, but the server does not verify the client.

## **Advantages of One-Way Authentication**

* **Simple & Efficient** → Only the server needs to be authenticated, reducing complexity.
* **Ensures Server Legitimacy** → Protects users from interacting with fake or malicious servers.
* **Widely Used & Supported** → Standard in web security and API communication.

## **Limitations of One-Way Authentication**

* **No Client Verification** → The server does not authenticate the client, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access.
* **Susceptible to Spoofing Attacks** → If a server’s authentication method is compromised, attackers can impersonate it.
* **Less Secure for Sensitive Transactions** → For critical operations like banking, **mutual authentication** is preferred.

## **When to Use One-Way Authentication?**

One-way authentication is ideal when:

* The **client only needs to verify the server's authenticity** (e.g., browsing websites securely).
* The **server’s identity is crucial**, but the client does not need to be authenticated (e.g., public APIs with API key-based access).
* **Performance is a priority**, and mutual authentication is not required.
