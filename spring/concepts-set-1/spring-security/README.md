# Spring Security

## About

Spring Security is a **security framework** that **handles authentication, authorization, and various security concerns** in Java applications. It is highly **customizable**, enabling developers to define security policies, manage user roles, enforce authentication rules, and protect applications from external threats.

### **Core Features of Spring Security:**

* **Authentication** – Verifies user identity using username/password, OAuth2, JWT, SAML, LDAP, etc.
* **Authorization** – Manages access control based on roles, permissions, or attributes.
* **Security Filters** – Protects against CSRF, XSS, Clickjacking, and more.
* **Session Management** – Handles session timeouts, concurrent sessions, and session fixation attacks.
* **Method-Level Security** – Restricts access to specific methods using annotations like `@PreAuthorize` and `@Secured`.
* **Integration with Authentication Providers** – Works with databases, OAuth2, OpenID Connect, JWT, LDAP, and more.
* **Custom Security Rules** – Fully customizable with security filters, access policies, and authentication mechanisms.

## Why Use Spring Security?

Spring Security provides **end-to-end security** for web applications, handling **authentication, authorization, session management, and protection against security threats**. Instead of manually implementing security features, **developers can leverage built-in functionalities** with minimal configuration.

### Integration with Spring Ecosystem

Spring Security seamlessly integrates with:

* **Spring Boot** – Auto-configured security with minimal setup.
* **Spring MVC** – Security for web controllers and REST APIs.
* **Spring Data JPA** – Role-based access control at the database level.
* **Spring OAuth2 & JWT** – Secure API authentication with tokens.

### Easy Configuration & Auto-Configuration

* Spring Boot automatically **configures basic security** with default login authentication.
* Developers can **override security settings** using `SecurityFilterChain` and `SecurityConfig`.
* Supports **Java-based configuration (no XML needed)** for modern applications.

### Industry-Standard Security Practices

Spring Security follows best security practices:

* BCrypt password hashing for secure storage.
* HTTPS enforcement to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
* Security headers (CSP, XSS protection, Content-Security-Policy).
* Secure session management for authentication.
