## **Positive & Non-Negative Integer**

* **Positive integer:** Any integer greater than 0 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ...).
* **Non-negative integer:** Any integer that is either 0 or greater than 0 (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, ...).

0 is not a positive integer, but it is a non-negative integer.

## **Mean**

Mean is a measure of central tendency that provides an average value for a dataset. It helps summarize the data by giving a single representative value.

### **Arithmetic Mean**

The Arithmetic Mean (AM) is the sum of all numbers in a dataset divided by the count of numbers. It represents the average value of the dataset.

### **Geometric Mean**

The Geometric Mean (GM) is the nth root of the product of all numbers in a dataset. It is often used for datasets involving growth rates or proportional changes.

### **Harmonic Mean (HM)**

It is the reciprocal of the average of the reciprocals of the values, used in rates like speed or efficiency.

### **Weighted Mean**

The average where each value has a specific weight or importance.
