# Basic Notes

## Excel Sheet

Excel organizes data into a **grid structure** consisting of **columns** and **rows**. Each cell is identified by a unique **address** derived from the column name and row number.

#### **1. Column Naming**

Columns in Excel are identified using **letters**:

* Columns are labeled from **A to Z** initially.
* After **Z**, the column names continue with two-letter combinations:
  * AA, AB, AC, ..., AZ, BA, BB, ..., BZ, CA, ..., and so on.
* This continues up to **XFD**, which is the last column in modern Excel versions (totaling 16,384 columns).

**Examples:**

* First column: **A**
* 26th column: **Z**
* 27th column: **AA**
* 702nd column: **ZZ**
* 703rd column: **AAA**
* Last column: **XFD**

#### **2. Row Naming**

Rows in Excel are identified using **numbers**:

* Rows are labeled starting from **1** and increment by 1 for each row.
* Modern Excel versions support up to **1,048,576 rows**.

**Examples:**

* First row: **1**
* 10th row: **10**
* 1,048,576th row: **1,048,576**

#### **3. Cell Addressing**

Each cell is uniquely identified by combining the **column letter** and the **row number**. For example:

* The first cell: **A1** (Column A, Row 1)
* A cell in the 5th column and 10th row: **E10**
* A cell in the 703rd column and 1st row: **AAA1**
