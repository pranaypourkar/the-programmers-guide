# Red-Black Trees

## About

In a regular **Binary Search Tree (BST)**, if you insert sorted data (say, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...), the tree becomes **unbalanced**, and performance degrades to **O(n)** â€” just like a linked list.

Self-balancing BSTs, such as **AVL Trees** and **Red-Black Trees**, solve this by **automatically restructuring** the tree to keep it balanced, so that all major operations (insert, delete, search) always stay **O(log n)** in time.
