# Dynamic Programming - TBU

## About

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful technique in computer science and mathematics used to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem only once, storing its result for future use. This approach avoids redundant computations, making it highly efficient for problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure properties.
