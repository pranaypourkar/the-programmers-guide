# Branching Strategies

## **About**

**Branching Strategies** define how developers structure and manage different streams of work within a Git repository. This includes how features, bug fixes, hotfixes, and releases are isolated, integrated, and promoted through the development lifecycle. Common strategies include **Git Flow**, **GitHub Flow**, and **Trunk-Based Development**, each offering unique advantages depending on team size, release frequency, and project complexity.

## **Importance**

In real-world development, unstructured branching often leads to unstable code, conflicting changes, and unpredictable releases. For example:

* A team working on both features and urgent hotfixes can benefit from **Git Flow**, which separates long-lived branches like `develop` and `release`.
* A fast-paced startup may choose **GitHub Flow** to deploy directly from `main` with lightweight feature branches.
* **Trunk-Based Development** helps large-scale teams (like at Google or Facebook) by reducing merge debt through continuous integration into a single shared branch.

Choosing the right branching strategy aligns your workflow with your delivery needs and ensures smoother collaboration, fewer conflicts, and a more predictable release cadence.
