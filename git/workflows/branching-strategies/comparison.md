## **Git Flow vs GitHub Flow vs Trunk-Based Development**

<table data-header-hidden data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="153.64453125"></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Topic</strong></td><td><strong>Git Flow</strong></td><td><strong>GitHub Flow</strong></td><td><strong>Trunk-Based Development</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Overview</strong></td><td>Multi-branch model for structured release and hotfix cycles.</td><td>Lightweight model focused on CI/CD with short-lived feature branches.</td><td>Developers work directly on <code>main</code> (trunk), with minimal branching.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Best Used For</strong></td><td>Large teams, enterprise apps, scheduled releases.</td><td>Web apps, microservices, fast-paced environments.</td><td>High-performance teams aiming for continuous integration/delivery.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Main Branches</strong></td><td><code>main</code>, <code>develop</code>, <code>feature/*</code>, <code>release/*</code>, <code>hotfix/*</code></td><td><code>main</code>, <code>feature/*</code></td><td>Primarily <code>main</code> or <code>trunk</code>, optional short-lived branches.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Branch Lifetime</strong></td><td>Long-lived branches (<code>develop</code>, <code>release</code>).</td><td>Short-lived branches merged via pull requests.</td><td>Very short-lived or no branches; commits go directly to trunk.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Release Management</strong></td><td>Structured: <code>release</code> and <code>hotfix</code> branches control releases.</td><td>No separate release branches; deploy from <code>main</code>.</td><td>Frequent, even daily releases from <code>main</code>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CI/CD Compatibility</strong></td><td>Works, but may require coordination for release branches.</td><td>Highly compatible with CI/CD.</td><td>Designed for CI/CD.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Deployment Frequency</strong></td><td>Low to moderate (weekly, bi-weekly).</td><td>High (daily or multiple times a day).</td><td>Very high (continuous delivery/deployment).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Complexity</strong></td><td>High — multiple branch types, strict workflows.</td><td>Low — simple and flexible.</td><td>Medium — simpler model but requires discipline and test automation.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Learning Curve</strong></td><td>Steep, due to number of branches and policies.</td><td>Easy to learn for small teams.</td><td>Medium — requires cultural shift toward frequent integration.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hotfixes</strong></td><td>Managed through dedicated <code>hotfix/*</code> branches.</td><td>Hotfixes pushed directly to <code>main</code>.</td><td>Hotfixes integrated directly in trunk (with high testing confidence).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Parallel Development</strong></td><td>Excellent — many teams can work in parallel safely.</td><td>Moderate — few active branches preferred.</td><td>Requires tight coordination; feature flags help manage changes.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Release Stability</strong></td><td>High — stabilization happens in <code>release</code> branches.</td><td>Depends on automation and discipline.</td><td>Very high with good automated testing and trunk discipline.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tooling Support</strong></td><td>Supported by most Git tools, but complex.</td><td>Native to GitHub and supported in others.</td><td>Supported in CI tools; less formal in Git tools.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Code Review</strong></td><td>Pull request review process varies, sometimes delayed.</td><td>Integral via pull requests.</td><td>Encouraged through short-lived branches or direct commits.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Rollback Strategy</strong></td><td>Rollback via hotfix or reverting release branches.</td><td>Rollback by reverting from <code>main</code>.</td><td>Rollback through trunk commits; feature flags help control exposure.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Real-World Use Cases</strong></td><td>Banks, enterprise software, apps with long QA cycles.</td><td>SaaS products, startups, DevOps-first teams.</td><td>Google, Meta, Netflix, high-scale engineering organizations.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Drawbacks</strong></td><td>Complex, slow for fast delivery, high merging overhead.</td><td>Risky without automation, lacks formal release cycle.</td><td>Can be risky if not supported by mature CI/CD/testing practices.</td></tr></tbody></table>
