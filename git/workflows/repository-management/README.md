# Repository Management

## **About**

**Repository Management** involves structuring, maintaining, and governing a Git repository to ensure it remains usable, secure, and scalable. It includes practices like branch naming conventions, access controls, tag usage, cleanup policies, and guidelines for commit hygiene.

## **Importance**

Over time, even small projects can become unmanageable if the repository isn't maintained:

* Dozens of stale branches confuse developers and bloat tooling like CI/CD or Git clients.
* Inconsistent naming (e.g., `feature/login` vs `feat-login`) leads to confusion and broken automation.
* Lack of access control can result in unauthorized or accidental changes to critical branches.

In large organizations, Git repositories are often linked to deployment systems, monitoring tools, and audits. Poor repository management can lead to:

* Delayed releases.
* Security risks.
* Frustrated developers.

Well-managed repositories contribute to team efficiency, security compliance, and clean project evolution.
