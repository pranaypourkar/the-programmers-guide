# Merge Strategies

## About

**Merge strategies** define how changes from one branch are incorporated into another. Git offers different strategies for merging branches depending on the project's structure, goals, and collaboration style. These strategies influence the **commit history**, **conflict resolution**, and the **clarity** of the project's development path.

Common merge strategies include:

* **Merge Commit** (default)
* **Rebase**
* **Squash and Merge**
* **Fast-forward Merge**
* **No Fast-forward Merge**

Understanding merge strategies is critical for maintaining a clean, readable, and traceable version history in any collaborative software project.

## **Importance**

#### **1. Clean and Understandable History**

* Choosing the right strategy helps keep the commit graph readable and structured.
* Helps future developers (or yourself) understand **why** and **when** certain changes were made.

#### **2. Effective Collaboration**

* In teams, clear strategies prevent accidental overwrites and conflicts.
* Enables teams to define **branching policies** (e.g., always squash before merging into `main`).

#### **3. Easier Debugging and Rollbacks**

* Linear or structured history makes it easier to use tools like `git bisect` or revert commits safely.

#### **4. Consistency Across Platforms**

* Merge strategies determine how GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc., handle Pull/Merge Requests.

#### **5. CI/CD Compatibility**

* Some CI/CD pipelines are triggered based on merge types or commit patterns.
* Choosing a strategy affects how and when builds/deployments happen.

#### **6. Better Release Management**

* Strategies like squash and merge allow keeping only meaningful changes in `main` or `release` branches, reducing noise.
