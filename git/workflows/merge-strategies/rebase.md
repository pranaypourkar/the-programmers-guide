# Rebase

## About

**Rebasing** is a Git operation that moves or “replays” commits from one branch onto another. Instead of creating a merge commit, rebase **rewrites the commit history** to create a linear sequence of commits.

It is often used to make the history cleaner by avoiding unnecessary merge commits.
