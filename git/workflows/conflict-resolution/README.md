# Conflict Resolution

## **About**

**Conflict Resolution** in Git involves handling situations where changes in two branches overlap or contradict. This usually happens during merge or rebase operations. This section explains how to identify conflicts, resolve them at the file or commit level, and validate resolutions safely before finalizing.

## **Importance**

In collaborative environments, merge conflicts are inevitable:

* Two developers might edit the same function or configuration file on separate branches.
* A hotfix might alter code that a feature branch also modifies, resulting in conflicts when merging.

Without proper knowledge, resolving conflicts can lead to overwritten changes, lost work, or broken builds. Real-world teams often face deployment delays due to improperly handled conflicts.

Mastering conflict resolution ensures developers:

* Avoid blocking CI/CD pipelines.
* Maintain stable, working builds.
* Collaborate confidently, even on overlapping work.

Tools like VS Code, GitKraken, or `git mergetool` combined with good practices help developers resolve issues without fear.
