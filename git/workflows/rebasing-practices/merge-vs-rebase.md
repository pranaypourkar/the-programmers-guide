# Merge vs Rebase

## About

<table data-header-hidden data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="155.4609375"></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Feature</strong></td><td><strong>Merge</strong></td><td><strong>Rebase</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>What it does</strong></td><td>Integrates changes from one branch into another by <strong>creating a new merge commit</strong> that records the union of both histories.</td><td>Moves the entire set of commits from your branch and <strong>reapplies them</strong> on top of another branch (usually the main one).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Effect on commit history</strong></td><td><strong>Preserves true historical timeline</strong>. You can see when and how two branches diverged and then merged.</td><td><strong>Rewrites history</strong> by changing the base of your branch, as if the commits were made sequentially on top of the target branch.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Structure of history</strong></td><td>Creates a <strong>non-linear history</strong> that shows the full branching structure and context of collaboration.</td><td>Creates a <strong>linear history</strong> that appears clean and ordered but loses details of when branches actually diverged.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>How it affects commits</strong></td><td>Keeps all existing commit hashes unchanged and adds one new commit (the merge commit).</td><td><strong>Changes commit hashes</strong>, dates, and potentially the order of commits, because commits are recreated during rebase.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Context preservation</strong></td><td>Preserves full historical context, including how and why branches were developed separately.</td><td>Loses the branching context — the rebased history looks like it happened in a straight line, regardless of the actual timeline.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Commit graph appearance</strong></td><td>You'll see <strong>branches merging</strong> back together with clear visual splits and merges in tools like Git log or GitKraken.</td><td>You'll see a <strong>single line of commits</strong> with no sign that a separate branch ever existed.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Typical usage scenario</strong></td><td>Used when integrating completed features or hotfixes back into main branches like <code>main</code> or <code>develop</code>.</td><td>Used when you want to clean up or prepare your feature branch before merging or submitting a PR.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Team collaboration</strong></td><td>Preferred in teams where multiple people work on the same branch — merge preserves everyone’s work cleanly.</td><td>Risky in shared branches — if you rebase after pushing, it creates problems for teammates pulling your changes.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Conflict resolution</strong></td><td>Conflicts (if any) occur once at the merge point, and the resolved state is committed with a merge commit.</td><td>Conflicts can happen <strong>at each commit</strong> being rebased, requiring step-by-step conflict resolution.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Use on shared branches?</strong></td><td>Safe and encouraged. Maintains stable collaboration and conflict resolution workflow.</td><td>Not safe <strong>after pushing to shared branches</strong>. Should only be done locally before pushing to avoid disrupting others.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Undo capability</strong></td><td>Easy to revert using <code>git revert -m 1 &#x3C;merge-commit></code> or by resetting to a previous known commit.</td><td>Harder to undo if pushed — rebased commits differ from original, making rollback complex.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Does it rewrite history?</strong></td><td>No. It simply adds to the existing commit graph.</td><td>Yes. It literally changes commit history by creating new versions of existing commits.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Best used when</strong></td><td>You want to maintain full visibility of parallel development paths.</td><td>You want a streamlined, clean history that appears as if all changes happened in sequence.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Impact on Git log</strong></td><td>Git log shows <strong>all merges and branches</strong>, giving you full traceability of how work was done.</td><td>Git log shows a <strong>linear stream of commits</strong>, hiding how work was divided across branches.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Impact on Pull/Merge Requests</strong></td><td>Merge commits provide <strong>clear indicators</strong> of when a PR was integrated and allow for easier PR traceability.</td><td>Rebased branches appear as if they were part of main all along — PR merge points disappear.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Command used</strong></td><td><code>git merge &#x3C;branch></code></td><td><code>git rebase &#x3C;branch></code></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Risk of error</strong></td><td>Low. Merge is a conservative operation that doesn’t change past history.</td><td>Medium to High. Rebase can be dangerous if misunderstood, especially when used after pushing.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Fast-forward behavior</strong></td><td>If no other changes exist, Git will fast-forward the branch pointer without creating a merge commit (unless using <code>--no-ff</code>).</td><td>Rebase achieves a fast-forward-like effect by restructuring commits ahead of time.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>How Git views them internally</strong></td><td>A merge is a new commit with <strong>two or more parents</strong>.</td><td>A rebase is a <strong>replay of commits</strong>, as if they were written from scratch on a new base.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Common in open-source projects?</strong></td><td>Yes. Many projects prefer merge to maintain an auditable history of PRs.</td><td>Sometimes used in PR cleanups, but usually done before opening a PR, not after.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Effect on history integrity</strong></td><td>Maintains a <strong>complete and truthful project history</strong>, ideal for auditing and debugging.</td><td>Creates a <strong>linear but rewritten history</strong>, good for small teams or solo developers.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Golden rule</strong></td><td>Use <code>merge</code> for <strong>shared work</strong>, and when preserving historical collaboration matters.</td><td>Use <code>rebase</code> for <strong>cleaning up local work</strong>, and when preparing for clean integration.</td></tr></tbody></table>
