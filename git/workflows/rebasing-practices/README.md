# Rebasing Practices

## **About**

**Rebasing Practices** refer to the use of `git rebase` to reapply commits from one branch onto another. Rebasing rewrites commit history to appear as though changes were made on top of a target branch, resulting in a cleaner, more linear project history. This section covers safe rebase usage, interactive rebasing, and when not to rebase.

## **Importance**

In real-world teams, merge commits can clutter the commit history, making it hard to trace who did what and when. For instance:

* A feature branch that spans weeks of development might include dozens of minor commits. Interactive rebasing lets you **squash** or **reword** them before merging into `main`, making code review and audit easier.
* Rebasing local branches before pushing avoids unnecessary merge commits and reduces conflict risk during pull requests.
* At companies practicing trunk-based development or pull request workflows, rebasing ensures a clean history without sacrificing individual contributions.

Used properly, rebasing enhances code traceability, simplifies debugging, and improves the quality of project history without introducing noise.
