# Bitbucket

## About

**Bitbucket** is a Git-based code hosting and collaboration platform developed by Atlassian. It enables teams to manage repositories, collaborate through pull requests and code reviews, and automate workflows via built-in CI/CD pipelines.

Unlike GitHub and GitLab, Bitbucket is deeply integrated with other Atlassian tools like **Jira, Confluence, and Trello**, making it a popular choice for teams already using the Atlassian ecosystem.

Bitbucket supports both **cloud-hosted** and **self-managed (Bitbucket Data Center)** options, giving teams flexibility based on security, scalability, and compliance needs.

## Importance of Bitbucket

Bitbucket is an important tool for teams seeking a tightly integrated development and project management workflow, especially those already using Atlassian products.

* **Deep Atlassian Integration**\
  Seamlessly connects with **Jira, Confluence, Trello**, and other Atlassian tools to link code with planning, documentation, and task tracking.
* **Team-Centric Collaboration**\
  Designed with team workflows in mind - pull requests, branch permissions, and inline code reviews promote structured collaboration.
* **Built-in CI/CD (Bitbucket Pipelines)**\
  Lets teams build, test, and deploy directly from the repository with simple YAML-based configuration.
* **Flexible Deployment Options**\
  Offers both **Bitbucket Cloud** for easy access and **Bitbucket Data Center** for enterprise-grade self-hosted deployments.
* **Granular Access Control**\
  Provides fine-grained permissions at the project, repo, and branch level to manage contributions securely.
* **Scalable for Enterprises**\
  Used by large teams and organizations for its integration, scalability, and centralized control over DevOps processes.
