# Platforms

## About

**Git Platforms** are web-based tools and services built on top of Git that provide collaborative features, repository hosting, and extended DevOps capabilities. While Git is a distributed version control system, platforms like **GitHub**, **GitLab**, **Bitbucket**, and **Azure Repos** offer hosted environments for managing Git repositories at scale within teams and organizations.

These platforms typically add features such as access control, pull/merge requests, branch protection, code reviews, CI/CD pipelines, issue tracking, and integrations with external tools.

## Purpose

Git platforms centralize Git repositories and simplify workflows for developers and DevOps teams. They enhance Git by providing:

* Centralized hosting of repositories (public or private)
* Collaboration tools (e.g., merge requests, code reviews)
* Project and issue management
* Access controls and permissions
* CI/CD automation and deployment support
* Integration with IDEs, ticketing systems, and cloud platforms

## Choosing the Right Platform

Selecting the right Git platform depends on several factors including your development workflow, team structure, integration requirements, scalability needs, compliance policies, and budget. Below are key evaluation dimensions and a comparative analysis to help us make an informed decision:

### Evaluation Criteria

<table data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="290.9366455078125">Criteria</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Team Size &#x26; Structure</strong></td><td>Small teams may prioritize simplicity; large enterprises need fine-grained access controls and auditability.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hosting Model</strong></td><td>Decide between SaaS (cloud-hosted) or self-managed (on-premise). Some platforms offer both.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CI/CD Capabilities</strong></td><td>Native CI/CD support can reduce tool sprawl and streamline workflows.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ecosystem Integration</strong></td><td>Consider compatibility with tools like Jira, Azure Boards, Slack, Kubernetes, or your cloud provider.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Security &#x26; Compliance</strong></td><td>Look for role-based access, 2FA, SAST, DAST, secret scanning, and audit logs.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Collaboration &#x26; Review Process</strong></td><td>Efficient pull/merge request workflows, reviewers, and approval rules support team agility.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pricing &#x26; Licensing</strong></td><td>Costs vary widely between free, team, enterprise, and self-hosted tiers. Evaluate features per tier.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Marketplace &#x26; Extensibility</strong></td><td>Availability of plugins, APIs, and integrations to extend functionality.</td></tr></tbody></table>
