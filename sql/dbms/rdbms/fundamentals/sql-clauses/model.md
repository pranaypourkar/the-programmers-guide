# MODEL

{% hint style="warning" %}
The `MODEL` clause is a feature specific to Oracle SQL and is not supported by all DBMS. It is unique to Oracle and provides advanced, spreadsheet-like calculation capabilities within SQL queries, which is not a standard feature across other SQL databases.
{% endhint %}

## Description

The `MODEL` clause in Oracle SQL is a feature that allows to perform inter-row and inter-column calculations in a spreadsheet-like fashion within a SQL query. It provides a way to define a multidimensional array and apply rules to it, enabling complex data manipulations and calculations.

## Key Features of the MODEL Clause

1. **Multidimensional Arrays**: Treats query results as multidimensional arrays.
2. **Rules-Based Calculations**: Allows the definition of rules for calculations that can span across rows and columns.
3. **Cell References**: Supports references to other cells in the array, similar to how spreadsheet cells can reference each other.

## Basic Syntax

Here is a simplified syntax of the `MODEL` clause:

```sql
SELECT ...
FROM ...
MODEL
    [ PARTITION BY (partition_clause) ]
    DIMENSION BY (dimension_clause)
    MEASURES (measure_clause)
    [ RULES (rule_clause) ];
```

* **PARTITION BY**: Divides the data into partitions, similar to a `GROUP BY` clause.
* **DIMENSION BY**: Specifies the dimensions of the array (e.g., rows or columns). In the context of the `MODEL` clause, dimensions act like rows in a spreadsheet
* **MEASURES**: Defines the measures or the actual data values that will be manipulated. Measures act like the data cells in a spreadsheet that can be manipulated.
* **RULES**: Contains the rules that define how calculations are performed.

Pseudo Keywords

**ANY:** This keyword refers to all members within a particular dimension. It's often used in conjunction with aggregate functions like `SUM` or `AVG` to calculate values across all elements in that dimension.

**CURRENT:** This keyword refers to the current row being processed within the model. It can be useful for calculations that depend on the values in the current row.\\

Pseudo Functions

**CV() (Current Value):** This function retrieves the value of a measure from the previous row within the same dimension partition. It's particularly helpful for calculations that involve comparisons or running totals.

**DENSE\_RANK() and RANK():** These functions assign ranking positions to members within a dimension, considering potential ties and gaps in the data. They can be used for calculations based on ranking or percentiles.

**LAG() and LEAD():** These functions access values from previous or subsequent rows within the same dimension partition, allowing for calculations that depend on past or future values.

### Simple example with no calculations or modifications (rules) applied to the data.

```
SELECT
    employee_id,
    salary
FROM
    employees
MODEL
    DIMENSION BY ( employee_id )  -- employee_id is the dimension
    MEASURES ( salary )           -- salary is the measure
    ( )                           -- empty rules section
ORDER BY
