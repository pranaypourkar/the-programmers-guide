# Partition

## About

Partitioning in Oracle is a database design technique that involves dividing a large table, index, or table-partitioned object into smaller, more manageable pieces, called **partitions**, while retaining it as a single logical entity. Each partition stores a subset of the data and can be managed and accessed individually, which improves performance, manageability, and scalability of large datasets.

**How Partitioning Works?**

1. **Partition Key**: A column (or set of columns) is designated as the partition key to determine how the data is distributed across partitions.
2. **Storage**: Partitions can be stored in separate tablespaces, enabling storage optimization.
3. **Access**: Queries and DML (Data Manipulation Language) operations automatically identify the relevant partitions to work on, ensuring optimal performance.

## **Key Features**

1. **Logical Transparency**: To users and applications, a partitioned table appears as a single table.
2. **Partition Independence**: Each partition can be accessed and managed individually without affecting others.
3. **Automatic Pruning**: Oracle automatically determines which partitions to access based on query conditions, reducing the amount of data scanned.
4. **Partition-Wise Operations**: Queries, updates, and maintenance can be parallelized at the partition level.
5. **Data Organization**: Data is segmented based on business logic (e.g., time ranges, regions), improving query performance.



## **Benefits of Partitioning**

1. **Improved Query Performance**: Partition pruning ensures that only the relevant partitions are scanned for queries, reducing I/O overhead.
2. **Scalability**: Large datasets are broken into smaller partitions, making them easier to manage.
3. **Enhanced Manageability**: Partitions can be added, dropped, or archived individually.
4. **Backup and Recovery**: Partitions stored in different tablespaces can be backed up and recovered independently.
5. **Parallel Processing**: Enables parallel execution of queries and operations across partitions.
6. **Data Lifecycle Management**: Makes it easy to manage "hot" (frequently accessed) and "cold" (historical) data using separate partitions.
