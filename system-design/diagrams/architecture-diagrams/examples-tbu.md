## 1. Monolithic Architecture Diagram

This diagram represents a traditional monolithic architecture where all functionalities—such as user account service, item service, order service, and payment service—are integrated into a single application. The application interacts with a relational database management system (RDBMS) to manage data.



## 2. Microservices Architecture Diagram

This diagram illustrates a microservices architecture where the application is divided into independent services like passenger management, driver management, trip management, and billing. Each service communicates through an API gateway and can have its own database, allowing for decentralized data management.
