# Architecture Diagrams

## About

Architecture diagrams provide a high-level overview of a systemâ€™s structure, showing different components, their interactions, and how they work together to achieve the system's goals.

## **Aspects of Architecture Diagrams**

* **Layers and Components**: Illustrates logical layers such as presentation, business, and data layers.
* **Data Flow**: Shows how data moves within the system.
* **Technology Stack**: Represents frameworks, databases, APIs, and other dependencies.
* **Scalability & Performance**: Highlights strategies for load balancing, caching, and distributed systems.
* **Security Considerations**: Displays authentication, authorization, encryption, and other security mechanisms.

## **Common Types of Architecture Diagrams**

1. **Monolithic Architecture Diagram** - Depicts a single-tiered software application.
2. **Microservices Architecture Diagram** - Shows an application composed of loosely coupled services.
3. **Layered Architecture Diagram** - Divides software into layers (e.g., UI, business logic, data access).
4. **Event-Driven Architecture Diagram** - Illustrates event producers, event buses, and event consumers.
5. **Serverless Architecture Diagram** - Represents a system relying on third-party cloud-managed services.
6. **Cloud Architecture Diagram** - Highlights cloud resources, virtual networks, and cloud service interactions.
7. **Client-Server Architecture Diagram** - Shows client devices interacting with backend servers.

## **Best Practices for Architecture Diagrams**

* Use clear and consistent notation (e.g., UML, C4 model, custom icons).
* Keep diagrams simple and readable by limiting unnecessary details.
* Label components, connections, and interactions clearly.
* Highlight key design decisions and trade-offs.
* Ensure diagrams remain up to date as the system evolves.
