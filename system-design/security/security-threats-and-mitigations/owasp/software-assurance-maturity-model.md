# Software Assurance Maturity Model

## About

The **OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)** is a **security framework** that helps organizations **assess, improve, and measure software security practices**. Unlike ASVS, which focuses on application security verification, **SAMM provides a structured model for integrating security into the software development lifecycle (SDLC).**

## What is OWASP SAMM?

OWASP SAMM is a flexible and scalable framework designed to help organizations analyze, measure, and improve their software security posture. It allows organizations to define security goals, implement best practices, and assess their progress over time.

* Helps in building secure software development processes.
* Provides a measurable way to track software security maturity.
* Offers best practices and recommendations for security improvements.

## Why is OWASP SAMM Important?

* **Proactive Security Approach** – Unlike traditional security testing, which occurs at the end of development, SAMM **integrates security at every stage** of SDLC.
* **Measurable Security Improvements** – Provides a **structured way to assess and improve** software security over time.
* **Tailored for Organizations of All Sizes** – Can be adapted to **startups, enterprises, and government agencies**.
* **Aligns with Compliance Standards** – Supports **ISO 27001, NIST, PCI-DSS, GDPR**, and other security standards.
* **Reduces Costs** – Helps **prevent security vulnerabilities** early, reducing the cost of fixing security issues later.

## OWASP SAMM Security Domains

SAMM is structured into **5 business functions**, each containing **three security practices**. These functions help organizations integrate security into software development.

## OWASP SAMM Maturity Levels

Each security practice in SAMM has **three maturity levels**. Organizations **assess their current maturity** and **work towards higher levels** by improving security processes.

## OWASP SAMM Business Functions – Detailed Overview

### **Governance (Strategic Security Management)**

* **Strategy & Metrics** – Defines **security goals, KPIs, and progress tracking**.
* **Policy & Compliance** – Ensures **regulatory and policy compliance** (GDPR, PCI-DSS, etc.).
* **Education & Guidance** – Implements **security training** for developers, architects, and stakeholders.

### **Design (Secure Software Design)**

* **Threat Assessment** – Conducts **threat modeling** to identify risks early.
* **Security Requirements** – Defines **security standards** for applications.
* **Secure Architecture** – Ensures **secure design patterns** are followed.

### **Implementation (Secure Coding & Deployment)**

* **Secure Build** – Enforces **code security scanning and dependency checking**.
* **Secure Deployment** – Implements **DevSecOps, CI/CD security, and automated testing**.
* **Secure Coding Practices** – Ensures **safe coding standards (e.g., input validation, authentication, cryptography)**.

### **Verification (Security Testing & Review)**

* **Security Testing** – Conducts **static (SAST) and dynamic (DAST) security testing**.
* **Code Review** – Enforces **manual and automated code reviews** for security.
* **Security Audits** – Regular **internal and external security assessments**.

### **Operations (Incident Response & Security Monitoring)**

* **Incident Response** – Implements **security monitoring, logging, and forensic capabilities**.
* **Operational Security** – Ensures **secure cloud and infrastructure configurations**.
* **Environment Hardening** – Protects applications from **misconfigurations, DDoS attacks, and server vulnerabilities**.

## How to Implement OWASP SAMM in SDLC ?

Organizations can follow these **five steps** to integrate SAMM into their software development lifecycle:

### **Step 1: Assessment (Where Are We?)**

* Evaluate **current security maturity** using the SAMM assessment model.
* Identify **weaknesses and gaps** in software security.

### **Step 2: Define Goals (Where Do We Want to Be?)**

* Set **security improvement goals** based on business risks.
* Choose relevant **maturity levels** and practices.

### **Step 3: Develop a Roadmap (How Do We Get There?)**

* Define a **step-by-step plan** to achieve security improvements.
* Prioritize **high-risk areas** and **quick wins**.

### **Step 4: Implement Security Improvements**

* Apply **best practices for secure development**.
* **Automate security testing** and integrate security controls into CI/CD pipelines.

### **Step 5: Continuous Monitoring & Improvement**

* Regularly assess **progress** and refine security processes.
* Use **metrics and audits** to measure security improvements.

## OWASP SAMM vs. OWASP ASVS – What’s the Difference?
