# Security Flaws

## About

Security flaws in applications are weaknesses or vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to gain unauthorized access, manipulate data, or disrupt services. The **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)** is dedicated to identifying and mitigating these security flaws by providing guidelines, tools, and best practices for secure software development.

## Why Understanding Security Flaws is Important

* Security flaws **increase the risk** of data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.
* Exploitable vulnerabilities can lead to **account takeovers, unauthorized transactions, or full system compromise**.
* Many security flaws arise due to **poor coding practices, misconfigurations, or lack of security awareness**.
* Understanding these flaws helps developers **build secure applications** from the ground up.
