# Threat Dragon

## About

OWASP Threat Dragon is an **open-source threat modeling tool** that helps developers, security teams, and architects design **secure applications** by identifying potential **security threats** and **mitigation strategies** early in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). It provides a **visual interface** to create **data flow diagrams (DFDs)** and evaluate possible attack vectors.

## Why is Threat Modeling Important?

Threat modeling is a **proactive security approach** used to **identify, analyze, and mitigate** security threats **before development** or **during early design stages**. OWASP Threat Dragon helps in:

* **Early detection of security vulnerabilities** before coding begins.
* **Reducing costs** by addressing security flaws before production.
* **Enhancing compliance** with security frameworks like OWASP ASVS, NIST, and ISO 27001.
* **Providing a structured method** for security analysis.
* **Integrating security into Agile & DevOps workflows**.

## Features of OWASP Threat Dragon

* **Visual Threat Modeling** – Allows creation of **data flow diagrams (DFDs)** to visualize application components, data flows, and trust boundaries.
* **Built-in Threat Libraries** – Provides **predefined attack patterns** and **security threats** for different components.
* **Security Controls & Mitigations** – Suggests **countermeasures** based on identified risks.
* **Supports STRIDE Threat Model** – Uses the **STRIDE methodology** (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privileges).
* **Integration with DevSecOps Pipelines** – Can be used in **CI/CD workflows** for automated security assessments.
* **Cross-Platform Support** – Available as a **web application** and **desktop application** for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## How OWASP Threat Dragon Works

The tool follows a **systematic approach** to **threat modeling**:

### **Step 1: Define Scope and Components**

* Identify **application architecture** and **key components**.
* Define **data flows, entry points, and trust boundaries**.

### **Step 2: Create a Threat Model using Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)**

* Design the system's **data flow** using **OWASP Threat Dragon's graphical interface**.
* Identify **actors, processes, data stores, and communication flows**.

### **Step 3: Identify Security Threats**

* Use the **STRIDE model** to categorize threats:
  * **Spoofing** – Impersonating a user or system.
  * **Tampering** – Altering data in transit or storage.
  * **Repudiation** – Performing actions without traceability.
  * **Information Disclosure** – Leaking sensitive data.
  * **Denial of Service (DoS)** – Disrupting service availability.
  * **Elevation of Privilege** – Gaining unauthorized access.

### **Step 4: Define Security Controls and Mitigation Strategies**

* Suggest **security countermeasures** for identified risks.
* Implement **OWASP ASVS** security requirements.

### **Step 5: Review and Iterate**

* Continuously update threat models as **architecture evolves**.
* **Re-evaluate risks** based on new security insights.
