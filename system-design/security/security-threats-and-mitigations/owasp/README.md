# OWASP

## About

The **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)** is a globally recognized non-profit organization focused on improving software security. Founded in 2001, OWASP provides a wealth of open-source tools, documentation, methodologies, and security frameworks that help developers, security professionals, and organizations build, test, and maintain secure applications.

OWASP operates independently, meaning that its resources and recommendations are vendor-neutral, freely available, and continuously updated to address modern security threats.

## Why is OWASP Important?

OWASP plays a **critical role in application security** by providing:

1. **Standardized Security Guidelines** – The OWASP Top 10, ASVS, and other frameworks define best security practices.
2. **Open-Source Security Tools** – Tools like OWASP ZAP and Dependency-Check help developers identify and fix vulnerabilities.
3. **Developer-Friendly Resources** – Cheat Sheets, security testing guides, and best practices simplify security integration.
4. **Industry Compliance Support** – OWASP recommendations align with standards like **ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, GDPR, and NIST**.
5. **Community-Driven Knowledge** – Continuous updates and contributions from cybersecurity experts worldwide ensure relevance to emerging threats.

## OWASP’s Influence in Cybersecurity

OWASP's frameworks and methodologies are widely used by:

* **Developers** to write secure code.
* **Security engineers** for penetration testing and threat analysis.
* **Organizations** to implement secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) practices.
* **Regulatory bodies** as a benchmark for security compliance.
