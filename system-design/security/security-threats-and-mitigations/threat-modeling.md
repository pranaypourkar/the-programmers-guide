# Threat Modeling

## About

Threat modeling is a structured approach to identifying, analyzing, and mitigating potential security threats in a system before they can be exploited. It helps organizations proactively assess risks and design secure systems by evaluating possible attack vectors, weaknesses, and mitigation strategies.

## **Why is Threat Modeling Important?**

1. **Early Identification of Security Risks** – Helps detect vulnerabilities in the design phase before they become costly to fix.
2. **Improves Security Posture** – Strengthens system defenses by anticipating and addressing threats in advance.
3. **Compliance & Regulatory Requirements** – Helps meet security standards like GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and ISO 27001.
4. **Reduces Attack Surface** – Minimizes the number of potential entry points attackers could exploit.
5. **Enhances Risk Management** – Provides insights into the likelihood and impact of security threats.

## **Steps in Threat Modeling**

### **1. Define the Scope & Objectives**

* Identify the system, application, or process being analyzed.
* Determine security goals and compliance requirements.
* Understand who the potential attackers are and what their motivations might be.

### **2. Understand the System Architecture**

* Document system components, data flow, APIs, and dependencies.
* Identify security boundaries (e.g., internal vs. external networks, user authentication layers).
* Use architecture diagrams to visualize the attack surface.

### **3. Identify Potential Threats**

* Analyze how data moves through the system and where vulnerabilities might exist.
* Identify common attack vectors such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), privilege escalation, etc.
* Consider insider threats, social engineering, and misconfigurations.

### **4. Analyze & Prioritize Risks**

* Assess threats based on **likelihood** and **impact** to prioritize mitigation efforts.
* Use risk assessment models like **DREAD** (Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users, Discoverability) or **CVSS** (Common Vulnerability Scoring System).

### **5. Define Mitigation Strategies**

* Apply **security controls** such as authentication mechanisms, encryption, access controls, and monitoring solutions.
* Follow **secure coding practices** to eliminate software vulnerabilities.
* Implement **least privilege** access controls to limit exposure.

### **6. Validate & Test the Threat Model**

* Conduct **penetration testing** and **security audits** to validate findings.
* Use **automated security tools** to simulate attacks.
* Continuously update the threat model as the system evolves.
