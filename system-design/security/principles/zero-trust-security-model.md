# Zero Trust Security Model

## About

The **Zero Trust Security Model** is a security framework that operates on the principle of **"Never Trust, Always Verify."** Unlike traditional security models that assume everything inside an organization's network is safe, Zero Trust requires strict verification for every user, device, and application trying to access resources—regardless of whether they are inside or outside the network perimeter.

## **Principles of Zero Trust**

1. **Continuous Verification** – Every access request must be authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated before granting permissions.
2. **Least Privilege Access** – Users and systems get only the minimum necessary access required for their tasks.
3. **Micro-Segmentation** – Networks are divided into small, isolated zones to limit the impact of breaches.
4. **Assume Breach Mentality** – Always operate under the assumption that an attacker is already inside the system.
5. **Device and Endpoint Security** – Verification extends beyond users to the security posture of devices accessing the system.
6. **Strong Authentication** – Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and risk-based authentication are enforced.
7. **Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring** – All access and activities are continuously monitored and logged to detect anomalies.
