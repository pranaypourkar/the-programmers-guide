# Secure Coding Practices

## About

Secure Coding Practices are **a set of guidelines, patterns, and guardrails** that developers follow to write code that is **resilient to vulnerabilities** and **maintains security** even when under attack. They sit at the **implementation phase** of SSDLC but influence both **design decisions** and **code review criteria**.

The ultimate aim is to ensure that code **meets functional needs without creating exploitable weaknesses**.

## **Foundational Principles of Secure Coding**
