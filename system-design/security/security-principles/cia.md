## About

The **CIA Triad** is a foundational model in cybersecurity that outlines the three core principles required for securing information systems. These principles—**Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**—form the basis for designing secure systems, preventing cyber threats, and ensuring data protection.

## **1. Confidentiality**

Confidentiality ensures that **sensitive data is accessible only to authorized individuals** and is protected from unauthorized access, disclosure, or interception. It prevents sensitive information from being exposed to malicious actors.

#### Aspects

* **Access Control:** Implements authentication (passwords, biometrics) and authorization (role-based access control).
* **Encryption:** Protects data in transit and at rest using cryptographic techniques like AES, RSA, or TLS.
* **Data Masking:** Hides sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers) from unauthorized users.
* **Network Security Measures:** Firewalls, VPNs, and secure communication protocols (HTTPS, SSH) restrict access.
* **Least Privilege Principle:** Limits access based on necessity, reducing the risk of internal threats.

#### **Threats to Confidentiality**

* **Unauthorized Access:** Hacking, phishing, or insider threats.
* **Data Leaks & Breaches:** Unsecured databases, weak authentication, or unencrypted data.
* **Eavesdropping & Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Intercepting communication in transit.

## **2. Integrity**

Integrity ensures that **data remains accurate, consistent, and unaltered** during storage, transmission, and processing. It protects data from unauthorized modification, corruption, or deletion.

#### Aspects

* **Hashing:** Uses cryptographic hash functions (SHA-256, MD5) to verify data integrity.
* **Checksums & Digital Signatures:** Detects unauthorized changes to files and messages.
* **Access Control & Audit Logs:** Tracks modifications and prevents unauthorized changes.
* **Database Constraints & Transactions:** Ensures consistency through ACID properties in databases.

#### **Threats to Integrity**

* **Data Tampering:** Malicious actors modifying sensitive files.
* **Malware & Ransomware:** Altering or encrypting data for extortion.
* **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Intercepting and modifying communication.
* **Hardware/Software Failures:** Corrupting stored data.

## **3. Availability**

Availability ensures that **systems, applications, and data are accessible to authorized users whenever needed**, without unnecessary delays or interruptions.

#### **Aspects**

* **Redundancy & Failover Mechanisms:** Backup systems prevent service disruptions.
* **Load Balancing:** Distributes traffic to ensure system responsiveness.
* **Disaster Recovery & Backup Plans:** Ensures quick recovery after failures.
* **DDoS Protection:** Uses firewalls and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to block malicious traffic.
* **Regular Maintenance & Patch Management:** Prevents downtime due to system vulnerabilities.

#### **Threats to Availability**

* **Denial-of-Service (DoS) & DDoS Attacks:** Overloading servers to disrupt services.
* **Hardware/Software Failures:** Crashes, misconfigurations, or outdated systems.
* **Natural Disasters:** Power outages, floods, or earthquakes affecting data centers.
* **Ransomware Attacks:** Encrypting data and demanding payment for decryption.

## **Balancing the CIA Triad**

While each principle is important, security strategies must balance all three:

* **Too much confidentiality** can reduce **availability** (e.g., excessive access restrictions may hinder legitimate users).
* **Prioritizing availability** too much may **compromise confidentiality** (e.g., weak authentication for ease of access).
* **Focusing solely on integrity** without availability can impact usability (e.g., over-restrictive security controls might slow down operations).
