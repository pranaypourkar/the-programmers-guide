# Proxy

TBD

Yes — **proxies often increase response time**, but the extent depends on several factors. Here’s why and how:

#### **Why a Proxy Can Increase Response Time**

**Additional Network Hops**\
When you use a proxy, your request **detours** through an intermediary server before reaching the destination. This adds at least one network hop.

**Processing Overhead**\
Proxies sometimes:

* Inspect, log, or modify requests/responses.
* Perform caching or load balancing.
* Apply security measures like firewall rules or TLS termination.

All these add processing time.

**Congestion or Load**\
If the proxy is overloaded, queued, or poorly optimized, it can **bottleneck traffic** and delay responses.

**Encryption/Decryption**\
SSL/TLS termination or re-encryption at the proxy can add milliseconds (though usually small).

#### **When Proxies Might&#x20;**_**Not**_**&#x20;Significantly Affect Performance**

* **Lightweight Layer 4 (TCP) proxies** just forward packets and add minimal delay.
* **Proxies close to the application server** (same data center or LAN) add negligible latency — often just a few milliseconds.
* **Caching** at the proxy can actually **reduce** response time (e.g. if the proxy returns a cached response instead of fetching from the backend).
