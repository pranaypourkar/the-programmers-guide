# Load Balancer Monitoring Tool

## About

Load balancer monitoring tools help ensure that traffic distribution and system performance are optimized, reducing downtime and improving overall system health. Monitoring key metrics like request rates, latency, error rates, and system resource utilization ensures that load balancers function efficiently. Below are some popular load balancer monitoring tools and platforms:

## **1. Prometheus with Grafana**

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit. When combined with Grafana for visualization, it becomes a powerful load balancer monitoring solution.
