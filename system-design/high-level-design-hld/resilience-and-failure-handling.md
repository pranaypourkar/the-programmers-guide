# Resilience & Failure Handling

## About

Resilience in system design refers to the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue operating with minimal disruption. Failure handling involves identifying, mitigating, and recovering from different types of failures.

A resilient system ensures high availability, reliability, and fault tolerance by employing various techniques like redundancy, failover mechanisms, circuit breakers, retries, and graceful degradation.

## **Characteristics of Resilient Systems**

* **Fault Tolerance** – The ability to continue operating despite hardware/software failures.
* **Self-Healing** – Automatically detects and recovers from failures.
* **Elasticity** – Adapts to changing workloads without failure.
* **Graceful Degradation** – Continues partial functionality even under failure conditions.
* **Redundancy** – Uses backup resources to maintain service availability.

## **Types of Failures in Distributed Systems**

Failures can occur at different levels in a system:

### **A. Hardware Failures**

* **Disk Failures** – Hard drive crashes, data corruption.
* **Network Failures** – Packet loss, high latency, network partitioning.
* **Power Failures** – Data center outages, insufficient backup power.

### **B. Software Failures**

* **Application Crashes** – Unhandled exceptions, memory leaks, out-of-memory errors.
* **Deadlocks & Race Conditions** – Threads competing for shared resources.
* **Configuration Issues** – Incorrect database credentials, invalid settings.

### **C. Human Errors**

* **Deployment Mistakes** – Pushing buggy code to production.
* **Misconfigurations** – Incorrect firewall settings, wrong database schema updates.
* **Accidental Data Deletion** – Human-caused data loss or corruption.

### **D. External Dependencies Failures**

* **Third-Party API Failures** – External service outages.
* **Cloud Service Downtime** – AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud region failures.

## **Failure Handling Strategies**

To build resilience, systems use different strategies to **detect, recover from, and prevent failures**.

### **A. Fault Detection**

1. **Health Checks** – Periodically test components (e.g., API health endpoints).
2. **Logging & Monitoring** – Track system behavior using logs and alerts (e.g., Prometheus, ELK Stack).
3. **Heartbeats & Watchdogs** – Periodic "I am alive" signals from services.
4. **Latency & Error Rate Tracking** – Detect slow responses and failures.

### **B. Fault Recovery Mechanisms**

1. **Retries & Exponential Backoff**
   * Retries failed operations with increasing delay.
   * Prevents excessive load on a failing system.
2. **Circuit Breakers**
   * Stops making requests to a failing service and attempts recovery after some time.
   * Example: Netflix’s **Hystrix** circuit breaker pattern.
3. **Failover & Redundancy**
   * Uses backup systems when the primary fails.
   * Example: Master-slave database replication.
4. **Graceful Degradation**
   * System provides partial functionality when under failure conditions.
   * Example: A search engine showing cached results when the database is unavailable.
5. **Load Balancing**
   * Distributes traffic across multiple instances to avoid overloading one node.
   * Example: Nginx, HAProxy, AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).
6. **Data Replication & Backups**
   * Stores copies of data to recover from failures.
   * Example: Database replication in PostgreSQL, MySQL.

## **Patterns for Resilience**

To enhance resilience, modern system architectures use various design patterns.

### **A. Leader Election**

* Used in distributed systems to **designate a primary (leader) node**.
* If the leader fails, another node takes over.
* Example: **Zookeeper, Raft Algorithm, Paxos Protocol**.

### **B. Bulkhead Pattern**

* **Isolates components** so that failures in one do not bring down the entire system.
* Example: Separating services into different clusters (e.g., database pool partitioning).

### **C. Event Sourcing & CQRS**

* **Logs every system event**, allowing easy rollback in case of failures.
* Example: **Apache Kafka** event-driven architecture.

### **D. Multi-Region Deployments**

* Runs services in multiple regions to **survive regional failures**.
* Example: AWS services using **Route 53 global traffic routing**.

## **Netflix Resilience Engineering**

Netflix is known for its highly resilient system design. Some of its resilience strategies include:

1. **Chaos Engineering**
   * Uses **Chaos Monkey** to randomly terminate instances to test resilience.
   * Helps identify weaknesses before real failures occur.
2. **Circuit Breakers & Bulkheads**
   * Uses **Hystrix** to handle failures in microservices.
   * Prevents cascading failures across the system.
3. **Auto Recovery & Self-Healing**
   * Services automatically restart on failure.
   * Uses **Eureka Service Discovery** for failover handling.
