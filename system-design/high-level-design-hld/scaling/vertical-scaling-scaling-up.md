# Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)

## About

Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up) refers to increasing the capacity of a single machine by upgrading its hardware resources such as CPU, RAM, disk storage, or network bandwidth. Instead of adding more machines, the existing system is made more powerful to handle a larger workload.

## **How Vertical Scaling Works?**

* The system runs on a single, more powerful server.
* Resources (CPU, RAM, Storage, Network) are increased to improve performance.
* Applications continue to run on the same instance, avoiding the complexity of distributed systems.
* Ideal for monolithic applications or databases that require high-speed transactions.

## **Techniques for Vertical Scaling**

### **1. Increasing CPU Power**

* Upgrading to a more powerful processor with more cores and higher clock speed.
* Useful for applications requiring high-speed computations (e.g., AI/ML processing).

### **2. Expanding RAM**

* Adding more RAM reduces disk I/O and speeds up memory-intensive operations.
* Useful for caching and database performance improvements.

### **3. Using Faster Storage (SSD vs HDD)**

* Switching from HDD to SSD improves disk read/write performance.
* Essential for high-performance databases and real-time processing.

### **4. Improving Network Bandwidth**

* Upgrading to a faster network interface card (NIC) reduces data transfer latency.
* Useful for handling a high number of concurrent users.

## **When to Use Vertical Scaling?**

Vertical scaling is ideal in the following scenarios:

* **Monolithic Applications:** Legacy applications that are not designed for distributed architectures.
* **Relational Databases:** Databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL perform better on a single high-performance machine.
* **Low-Latency Systems:** Systems where network delays should be minimized.
* **Regulatory or Compliance Constraints:** Some industries require keeping all data on a single machine.
