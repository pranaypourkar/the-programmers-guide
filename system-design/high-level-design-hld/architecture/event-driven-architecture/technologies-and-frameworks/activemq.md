# ActiveMQ

## About

**Apache ActiveMQ** is an open-source, multi-protocol, Java-based message broker designed to facilitate **asynchronous communication** in **distributed systems**. It plays a foundational role in **Event Driven Architecture (EDA)** by acting as the mediator between producers and consumers, enabling loose coupling and high availability.

At its core, ActiveMQ is based on the **Message-Oriented Middleware (MOM)** paradigm. MOM enables software components or applications to communicate and coordinate actions by exchanging messages, without needing to be tightly integrated or aware of each otherâ€™s internal workings.

This decoupling is achieved through two primary message communication models:

1. **Point-to-Point (Queue-based)**: One producer sends a message, and one consumer receives it.
2. **Publish-Subscribe (Topic-based)**: One producer broadcasts a message, and multiple consumers can receive it.

ActiveMQ abstracts these models into its JMS-compliant API and enhances them with robust delivery, persistence, and routing mechanisms.

## Role in Event Driven Architecture

In an Event Driven Architecture, ActiveMQ acts as the **event transport layer**. It enables:

* **Decoupling of services**: Services don't call each other directly but communicate via messages.
* **Scalability**: Messages can be load-balanced across consumers.
* **Asynchronous processing**: Producers send messages and move on without waiting for responses.
* **Resilience**: Messages can be stored and retried, enabling fault-tolerant behavior.

## Architectural Benefits of Using ActiveMQ

* **Separation of Concerns**: Services focus on producing/consuming events without knowing each other's business logic.
* **Time Independence**: Senders and receivers do not need to be active at the same time.
* **Resilience**: System remains operational even when certain components are down or lagging behind.
* **Performance Optimization**: High throughput and reduced bottlenecks with asynchronous processing.

## ActiveMQ Components

<table><thead><tr><th width="170.23828125">Component</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Broker</strong></td><td>The central server that manages message routing between producers and consumers.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Producer</strong></td><td>Application that sends messages to a queue or topic.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Consumer</strong></td><td>Application that receives messages from a queue or topic.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Queue</strong></td><td>Used in point-to-point messaging. Only one consumer processes a message.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Topic</strong></td><td>Used in publish-subscribe messaging. All active subscribers receive the message.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Virtual Topic</strong></td><td>Hybrid model where messages published to a topic are copied to multiple consumer queues.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Persistence Store</strong></td><td>KahaDB, JDBC or other databases used to store messages for durability.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Messaging Patterns Supported

ActiveMQ supports multiple messaging patterns that are essential in real-world systems:

* **Command Pattern**: Systems send commands for other services to act upon.
* **Event Notification**: Inform other systems about state changes or events.
* **Request/Reply**: A pattern where the sender expects a response back (though not ideal for high throughput).
* **Retry with Backoff**: Built-in support for redelivery policies and dead-letter queues.

## Protocols and Interoperability

ActiveMQ supports several messaging protocols, making it flexible and integrable across various languages and platforms:

* **OpenWire** (native)
* **AMQP**
* **MQTT**
* **STOMP**
* **REST & WebSocket**

This makes it suitable for heterogeneous environments, including **IoT**, **JavaEE**, **microservices**, and **legacy systems**.
