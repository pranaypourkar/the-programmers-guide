# Tracing Modes

## About

In distributed systems, tracing enables developers and operators to understand how requests flow across multiple services, components, or systems. Tracing captures **where a request originated, how long each operation took, where it went, and whether it succeeded or failed**.

However, distributed systems involve many communication patternsâ€”some synchronous, some asynchronous, some initiated by systems or users. **Each of these patterns requires a different tracing mode.**
