# Design Metrics

## About

Design Metrics are quantitative measures used to evaluate the quality, structure, and maintainability of a software design.\
While principles and patterns guide how a system should be built, metrics provide an **objective way to assess whether the design meets those goals**.

They help detect architectural weaknesses early, measure the impact of design changes, and ensure the system remains scalable, maintainable, and adaptable over time.

Commonly used design metrics include:

* **Coupling** – The degree of interdependence between modules or components.
* **Cohesion** – The degree to which the elements within a module belong together.
* **Cyclomatic Complexity** – The number of independent paths through a program's source code.
* **Maintainability Index** – A composite score that indicates how maintainable the codebase is.

By combining these and other metrics, development teams can monitor design quality throughout the software lifecycle.

## Why It Matters ?

In software design, what we don’t measure will eventually become a problem.\
Without metrics, design quality is based on gut feeling, which often leads to hidden complexity, high maintenance costs, and unpredictable failures over time.

Design Metrics provide **objective, quantifiable insights** into the health of a system. They help teams make data‑driven decisions rather than relying on subjective opinions.

**Some of the important reasons is as follows:**

* **Prevent Architectural Decay** – Detect issues like tight coupling, low cohesion, and excessive complexity before they erode system stability.
* **Guide Refactoring Efforts** – Pinpoint exactly where improvements are needed instead of making random, risky changes.
* **Reduce Maintenance Costs** – Well‑measured systems are easier to troubleshoot, extend, and upgrade.
* **Enable Predictable Scaling** – Strong design metrics correlate with architectures that scale cleanly as features and users grow.
* **Foster Accountability** – Provide an objective framework for discussing design quality within teams and across stakeholders.
* **Support Continuous Improvement** – Track changes in metrics over time to ensure design health improves, not degrades.

In short, **metrics turn good design from an art into an engineering discipline -** ensuring that systems remain reliable, maintainable, and scalable for years to come.
