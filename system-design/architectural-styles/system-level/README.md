# System-Level

## About

**System-Level Architectural Styles** define **how an entire software system is organized, deployed, and operated as a whole**. They focus on the **boundaries, communication patterns, and deployment units** that make up the system.

Unlike **application-level** architectures - which describe how code is structured _within_ a single application - system-level styles govern **how multiple applications, services, or functions interact and work together in production**.

At this level, architecture decisions influence:

* **Service boundaries** - where one deployable unit ends and another begins.
* **Communication** - how units talk to each other (HTTP, messaging, event streams, etc.).
* **Deployment** - whether the system is deployed as a single unit, multiple independent units, or on-demand functions.
* **Scalability model** - how the system grows to handle more load.
* **Fault isolation** - how failures in one part of the system affect (or don’t affect) the rest.

## Why it Matters ?

Choosing the right **system-level architectural style** is not just a technical decision - it’s a **strategic business choice**. It affects **how our teams work, how quickly we can deliver features, how resilient our system is to failure, and how much it costs to run**.

#### **1. Direct Impact on Scalability**

* A monolith might require scaling the entire application, even if only one part is under heavy load.
* Microservices and serverless allow **scaling specific components**, optimizing infrastructure usage.
* The choice determines whether we scale _vertically_ (bigger machines) or _horizontally_ (more machines).

#### **2. Influences Deployment Speed and Agility**

* Smaller, independently deployable units (microservices, serverless) enable **faster release cycles** and **lower deployment risk**.
* Large monoliths may require **coordinated releases** and long testing cycles.

#### **3. Shapes Fault Isolation and Reliability**

* In a monolith, a single bug can crash the entire application.
* In microservices, faults are **contained -** one failing service doesn’t necessarily take down the rest.
* Event-driven architectures can **buffer failures** through retries and queues.

#### **4. Dictates Operational Complexity**

* Monoliths are simpler to operate but can become bottlenecks as the system grows.
* Distributed styles (microservices, serverless) require **monitoring, service discovery, orchestration, and observability tools**.
* The style defines the **DevOps maturity** needed to run it effectively.

#### **5. Affects Cost Structure**

* Monoliths often run continuously on dedicated infrastructure (fixed cost).
* Serverless operates on a **pay-per-use model**, potentially lowering costs for sporadic workloads.
* Microservices may increase infrastructure spend due to **overhead of multiple deployments**.

#### **6. Aligns with Team Organization (Conway’s Law)**

* The system’s structure often mirrors the organization’s communication patterns.
* **Small, autonomous teams** work best with microservices.
* **Centralized teams** often prefer monoliths for simplicity.

#### **7. Determines Long-Term Flexibility**

* Our system-level architecture sets the **upper limit** on how independently we can evolve features.
* Moving from one style to another later (e.g., Monolith → Microservices) is **costly and disruptive**.

## Scope of System-Level Style

**System-level architectural styles** define the **macro structure** of a software system - its **deployment boundaries, interaction models, and runtime topology**. The scope here is **bigger than any single application** and focuses on how the **entire system behaves in production**.

#### **1. Unit of Deployment**

* Defines **what is deployed as a whole** - a single artifact (monolith), multiple independent services (microservices), or many small functions (serverless).
* Influences **release planning**, **rollback strategy**, and **versioning** across the system.

#### **2. Inter-Service Communication**

* Determines how components talk to each other:
  * **Synchronous**: HTTP APIs, gRPC calls.
  * **Asynchronous**: message queues, event streams.
* The choice affects **latency**, **throughput**, and **fault tolerance**.

#### **3. Deployment Infrastructure**

* Specifies **where and how** components run:
  * On dedicated servers (physical/VMs).
  * In containers (Docker, Kubernetes).
  * On serverless platforms (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions).
* Impacts **infrastructure cost, elasticity, and scaling strategies**.

#### **4. Operational Characteristics**

* System-level style dictates:
  * **Scaling** model (whole system vs. individual components).
  * **Fault isolation** mechanisms.
  * **Monitoring & observability** needs.
  * **Security boundaries** (network segmentation, API gateways).

#### **5. Team and Workflow Structure**

* Aligns with **how teams own and deliver software**:
  * Centralized teams = simpler, monolithic systems.
  * Decentralized teams = distributed, service-based architectures.
* Affects **onboarding time**, **knowledge silos**, and **cross-team dependencies**.

#### **6. Evolution and Adaptability**

* Determines **how easily the system can evolve**:
  * Adding features without affecting unrelated parts.
  * Adopting new tech stacks for different components.
  * Migrating to newer deployment models.

## Types

System-level architectural styles determine how a system is **packaged, deployed, and scaled** in production. Each style offers a distinct approach to **component boundaries, communication methods, and operational control**.

Choosing a style isn’t about “best” or “worst,” but about **matching trade-offs** to our **team’s needs, business goals, and operational constraints**.

## Which One to Choose ?

Selecting a **system-level architectural style** is less about _picking the most popular trend_ and more about aligning with **business goals, team capabilities, and operational realities**. The right choice balances **scalability, maintainability, cost, and delivery speed** for our specific context.

### **Decision Drivers**

| **Factor**                           | **When It Points to Monolith**                  | **When It Points to Microservices**        | **When It Points to Serverless**     | **When It Points to Event-Driven**                |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Team Size & Skills**               | Small, full-stack team; limited ops experience. | Multiple teams with specialized domains.   | Small teams without infra engineers. | Teams familiar with async processing & messaging. |
| **Product Maturity**                 | Early-stage MVPs, rapid iteration needed.       | Mature product with well-defined domains.  | Experimental/short-lived projects.   | Systems where decoupling is a must from day one.  |
| **Scalability Needs**                | Vertical scaling is enough.                     | Horizontal scaling per service.            | Auto-scaling per function.           | Extreme concurrency & high throughput workloads.  |
| **Release Independence**             | Whole system updates together.                  | Services updated independently.            | Functions updated independently.     | Components react to events independently.         |
| **Operational Complexity Tolerance** | Low.                                            | Medium–High.                               | Low–Medium (managed by cloud).       | Medium–High (event tracking, retries).            |
| **Latency Sensitivity**              | Low network hops; good for low latency.         | Slightly more latency due to service hops. | Possible cold-start delays.          | Async by design, not for hard real-time.          |

### **Practical Guidelines**

1. **Start Simple, Evolve Later**
   * For early products, a monolith often delivers faster value and can later be decomposed into services.
2. **Match to our Scaling Pattern**
   * If only _some parts_ of our system need scaling, microservices or event-driven styles can save resources.
3. **Consider our Team’s Ops Capability**
   * Microservices and event-driven systems require **strong DevOps, observability, and CI/CD** maturity.
4. **Think About Cost Over Time**
   * Serverless may be cheaper initially but can get expensive at high scale. Monoliths may need fewer resources but can slow delivery later.
5. **Avoid Over-Engineering**
   * Don’t adopt a style just because it’s trendy - architectural complexity should match real needs.
