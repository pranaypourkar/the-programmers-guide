# Design Layers

## About

Design Layers refer to the distinct levels of abstraction used to describe a system’s architecture and implementation details. By separating concerns across layers, design layers help manage complexity and provide a clear roadmap from high-level concepts to detailed specifications.

The two primary layers typically covered are:

* **High-Level Design (HLD):** Focuses on the overall system architecture, major components, and their interactions. It answers “what” the system will do and “how” components collaborate.
* **Low-Level Design (LLD):** Dives into the internal details of each component, such as class structures, data models, and algorithms. It answers “how” the system will be built technically.

Together, these layers form a comprehensive blueprint that guides developers, testers, and stakeholders through the development lifecycle.

## Why It Matters ?

Design Layers are important because they:

* **Manage Complexity:** Breaking down systems into layers simplifies understanding and development.
* **Improve Communication:** Different stakeholders can focus on the level of detail relevant to them.
* **Facilitate Scalability:** Layered design supports modularity and easier future enhancements.
* **Enhance Maintainability:** Changes in one layer (e.g., implementation details) can often be made without impacting others.
* **Guide Development:** Provides a structured approach to moving from conceptual architecture to actual implementation.
