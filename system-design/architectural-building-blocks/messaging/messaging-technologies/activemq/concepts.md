# Concepts

## 1. Does reading a message automatically remove it from ActiveMQ?

In ActiveMQ, whether a message is removed after being read depends on the **acknowledgment mode** and the behavior of the **consumer**. Here's how it works:

#### **1. Acknowledgment Modes**

ActiveMQ uses acknowledgment modes to determine when a message can be safely removed from the queue. These are the key acknowledgment modes:

**a. AUTO\_ACKNOWLEDGE**

* **Default Behavior**:
  * Messages are automatically acknowledged when they are successfully delivered to a consumer.
  * Once acknowledged, the message is removed from the queue.
* Use case: Simplifies handling but less control over message processing.

**b. CLIENT\_ACKNOWLEDGE**

* **Behavior**:
  * The consumer explicitly acknowledges the message using `message.acknowledge()`.
  * Messages are not removed from the queue until acknowledged.
  * If the consumer fails to acknowledge, the message remains in the queue for redelivery.
* Use case: Useful for fine-grained control over message acknowledgment.

**c. DUPS\_OK\_ACKNOWLEDGE**

* **Behavior**:
  * Similar to `AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE`, but allows for duplicate messages if acknowledgment is delayed.
  * Messages are removed after being acknowledged.
* Use case: Suitable when duplicate messages are acceptable, like in certain log-processing scenarios.

**d. TRANSACTIONAL**

* **Behavior**:
  * Messages are acknowledged only when the transaction is committed.
  * If the transaction rolls back, the messages remain in the queue.
* Use case: Required for transactional message processing.

#### **2. Persistence and Redelivery**

* If the queue is **persistent** (default), unacknowledged messages are stored in the broker's disk storage and redelivered when the consumer reconnects or retries.
* If the queue is **non-persistent**, unacknowledged messages are lost if the broker restarts.

#### **3. Example Scenarios**

**a. Consumer Reads Message Successfully (Default: AUTO\_ACKNOWLEDGE)**

* Message is delivered to the consumer.
* Broker receives acknowledgment (auto).
* Message is removed from the queue.

**b. Consumer Reads but Fails to Process (CLIENT\_ACKNOWLEDGE)**

* Message is delivered but not acknowledged.
* Broker keeps the message in the queue for redelivery.

**c. Consumer in a Transaction**

* Message is delivered as part of a transaction.
* If the transaction commits, the message is removed.
* If the transaction rolls back, the message remains in the queue.

#### **4. Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) Handling**

If a message cannot be successfully delivered (e.g., after exceeding the maximum redelivery attempts), it is moved to a **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**. This ensures problematic messages are not lost but also do not block the queue.

## 2. Reduce memory in activemq.xml

To reduce memory usage in ActiveMQ, we can modify its configuration, including settings for the memory limits of destinations (queues/topics), as well as other parameters related to memory management. Here's how we can export the `activemq.xml` file, edit it, and apply changes to reduce memory usage.

#### Steps to Export and Edit `activemq.xml`:

1. **Locate the `activemq.xml` Configuration File**:
   * In Docker, the `activemq.xml` file is typically located in the `/opt/activemq/conf/` directory inside the container.
   * We can either copy this file from the container to our local machine or mount a local configuration file in the Docker container.
2. **Copy the `activemq.xml` Configuration File to Local Machine**:
   *   If we want to edit it locally, we can copy the `activemq.xml` file from the container to our local machine using `docker cp`:

       ```bash
       docker cp activemq:/opt/activemq/conf/activemq.xml ./activemq.xml
       ```
3. **Edit `activemq.xml` File**:
   * Once the `activemq.xml` file is on our local machine, open it in our favorite text editor (e.g., `nano`, `vim`, or a GUI-based editor).
   * Look for sections related to memory configuration. Here are some common parameters we can adjust to reduce memory usage:

#### Key Configurations to Adjust Memory Usage:

1.  **Memory Limits for Queues (Destination Policy)**:

    * We can adjust the memory limits for queues or topics to ensure that messages are not retained in memory for too long.
    * For example, set `memoryLimit` in the `<destinationPolicy>` section:

    ```xml
    <destinationPolicy>
        <policyMap>
            <policyEntries>
                <policyEntry queue=">" >
                    <!-- Set a memory limit for queues (in MB) -->
                    <memoryLimit>64mb</memoryLimit>
                </policyEntry>
                <policyEntry topic=">" >
                    <!-- Set a memory limit for topics (in MB) -->
                    <memoryLimit>64mb</memoryLimit>
                </policyEntry>
            </policyEntries>
        </policyMap>
    </destinationPolicy>
    ```

    This configuration ensures that queues and topics are limited to 64 MB of memory. When the memory limit is reached, ActiveMQ will start applying flow control, preventing producers from flooding the broker with messages.
2.  **Memory Limits for Broker**:

    * We can set a memory limit for the entire broker in the `<broker>` tag. This is helpful if we want to control the overall memory usage.

    ```xml
    <broker xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core"
            brokerName="localhost" dataDirectory="${activemq.data}">
        <!-- Set the memory limit for the broker -->
        <memoryUsage>
            <memoryLimit>512mb</memoryLimit>  <!-- Set total memory for broker -->
        </memoryUsage>
    </broker>
    ```
3.  **Reduce Message Size Limits**:

    * We can also reduce the size of individual messages being sent, which can help prevent high memory usage by large messages.

    ```xml
    <destinationPolicy>
        <policyMap>
            <policyEntries>
                <policyEntry queue=">" >
                    <!-- Set a maximum message size -->
                    <maxMessageSize>1000000</maxMessageSize>  <!-- 1 MB -->
                </policyEntry>
            </policyEntries>
        </policyMap>
    </destinationPolicy>
    ```
4.  **Producer Flow Control**:

    * ActiveMQ uses **Producer Flow Control** to prevent producers from overloading the broker by applying backpressure when memory limits are reached. We can enable or tweak this setting in the configuration:

    ```xml
    <broker xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core"
            brokerName="localhost" dataDirectory="${activemq.data}">
        <!-- Enable producer flow control -->
        <producerFlowControl>false</producerFlowControl>  <!-- Disable if needed -->
    </broker>
    ```

#### 4. **Mount the Edited `activemq.xml` Back to Docker**:

*   Once we've made our edits, we can either:

    *   Copy the modified `activemq.xml` back into the container using `docker cp`:

        ```bash
        bashCopyEditdocker cp ./activemq.xml activemq:/opt/activemq/conf/activemq.xml
        ```
    * Or, if we're using Docker Compose, we can mount the modified `activemq.xml` file directly to the container by adding a `volumes` section to our `docker-compose.yml`:

    ```yaml
    activemq:
      container_name: activemq
      image: symptoma/activemq:5.17.3
      privileged: true
      ports:
        - "61616:61616"
        - "8161:8161"
      healthcheck:
        test: /opt/activemq/bin/activemq query --objname type=Broker,brokerName=*,service=Health | grep Good
        interval: 10s
        timeout: 5s
        retries: 5
      volumes:
        - ./activemq.xml:/opt/activemq/conf/activemq.xml
    ```

5. **Restart ActiveMQ**:
   *   After applying the changes, restart the container to apply the new configuration:

       ```bash
       bashCopyEditdocker-compose down
       docker-compose up -d
       ```
6. **Monitor ActiveMQ Memory Usage**:
   * Check the ActiveMQ logs and web console to ensure that memory usage is now within the limits we've configured. We can monitor memory usage in the ActiveMQ Web Console at `http://localhost:8161` (default).
