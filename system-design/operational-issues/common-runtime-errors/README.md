# Common Runtime Errors

## About

This section captures frequently encountered runtime failures that occur in production systems due to resource exhaustion, misconfiguration, or design oversights. It focuses on critical low-level issues such as out-of-memory errors, native thread limits, file descriptor exhaustion, garbage collection stalls, and CPU saturation.

## **Importance in System Design**

* **Reveals the hidden costs of poor design choices**: Using unbounded queues or thread pools may work in test environments but lead to production crashes.
* **Promotes production-aware architecture**: Understanding runtime errors helps you design systems that stay healthy under stress.
* **Links theory to practice**: Shows how architectural patterns (e.g., concurrency, async processing) translate into real-world risks.
* **Strengthens operational readiness**: Anticipating common runtime issues allows better defaults, safeguards, and observability from the beginning.
* **Supports capacity planning and resource tuning**: Helps determine sensible limits for threads, memory, and CPU in design and deployment configurations.
