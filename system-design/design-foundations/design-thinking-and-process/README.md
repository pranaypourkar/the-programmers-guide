# Design Thinking & Process

## About

**Design Thinking & Process** is the structured, iterative approach to solving complex problems in a way that balances **technical feasibility**, **business goals**, and **user needs**.\
It’s not just about _what_ to build - it’s about _how_ to think before building, ensuring that the resulting system is **fit for purpose, adaptable, and maintainable**.

In **System Design**, this means:

* Clearly defining the problem before jumping to solutions
* Understanding the system’s users, workflows, and constraints
* Breaking large challenges into manageable parts
* Validating designs early through iteration

The process is **non-linear -** we may revisit earlier stages as new information emerges. The goal is to **reduce risk, uncover blind spots, and make deliberate design trade-offs**.

Good design is not a single moment of inspiration - it’s a disciplined process of **understanding, exploring, testing, and refining**.

## Why It Matters ?

Without a **clear, structured design process**, teams risk building the wrong system - or the right system in the wrong way.

1. **Avoids Misalignment**\
   Many failed projects stem from unclear goals or misunderstood requirements. A defined process keeps developers, product managers, and stakeholders on the same page.
2. **Reduces Costly Rework**\
   Discovering major flaws late in development can be expensive. An iterative process catches issues early when they’re cheaper to fix.
3. **Balances Trade-offs**\
   System design often requires choosing between speed vs. scalability, cost vs. performance, or simplicity vs. flexibility.\
   A structured approach ensures these trade-offs are explicit and intentional.
4. **Enables Scalability of the Design Process**\
   In small teams or large distributed organizations, having a repeatable design process allows consistent quality and decision-making.
5. **Promotes Innovation**\
   By spending time in problem framing and iteration, teams can explore creative architectures rather than defaulting to the obvious or familiar.
