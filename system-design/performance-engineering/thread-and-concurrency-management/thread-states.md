# Thread States

## About

Thread states describe the current status of a thread in a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). These states help understand how the application is using threads â€” whether they are actively working, waiting, blocked, or idle.

Tracking thread states is important in production systems to:

* Diagnose performance bottlenecks
* Detect thread leaks
* Understand concurrency behavior
* Optimize thread pool configuration
