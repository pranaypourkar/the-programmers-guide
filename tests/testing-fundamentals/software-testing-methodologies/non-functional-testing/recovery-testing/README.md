# Recovery Testing

## About

**Recovery Testing** is a type of non-functional testing that evaluates how well a system can **recover from failures, crashes, hardware malfunctions, or unexpected interruptions** and resume normal operations.\
Its main objective is to verify that the system can **restore data, maintain integrity, and continue functioning** within acceptable time limits after a failure.

This testing goes beyond basic error handling, it focuses on **system resilience and disaster readiness**, ensuring that downtime is minimal and that no critical data is lost.\
Recovery testing may involve deliberately causing system failures, network outages, power loss, or data corruption to measure how effectively the system returns to stable operation.

## Purpose of Recovery Testing

* **Evaluate System Resilience**\
  Ensure the system can withstand unexpected failures and restore operations smoothly.
* **Measure Recovery Time**\
  Determine the time it takes for the system to return to normal functioning after a failure.
* **Verify Data Integrity Post-Recovery**\
  Ensure that no data is lost or corrupted during the recovery process.
* **Assess Fault-Tolerant Mechanisms**\
  Validate the effectiveness of backup systems, failover clusters, and redundancy measures.
* **Simulate Real-World Disaster Scenarios**\
  Test recovery procedures for conditions like server crashes, database failures, or network breakdowns.
* **Support Business Continuity Planning**\
  Ensure that recovery processes align with the organization’s Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO).
* **Minimize Downtime Impact**\
  Confirm that the system can recover quickly enough to avoid significant business losses.

## Aspects of Recovery Testing

Recovery testing evaluates multiple dimensions of how a system handles and recovers from failure scenarios.\
Key aspects include:

#### 1. **Failure Simulation**

Deliberately introducing system failures such as crashes, network outages, power loss, or service interruptions to assess recovery behavior.

#### 2. **Recovery Time**

Measuring the time taken to restore full functionality after a failure, aligning with defined **Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)**.

#### 3. **Data Recovery**

Ensuring that data lost during the failure is restored accurately, meeting **Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)**.

#### 4. **System State Preservation**

Verifying that the application resumes from the exact state before the failure or handles incomplete transactions appropriately.

#### 5. **Backup and Restore Validation**

Testing backup processes, storage media reliability, and restore procedures to confirm they work as intended.

#### 6. **Failover and Redundancy Mechanisms**

Assessing the effectiveness of alternate systems or servers that take over during failures.

#### 7. **Error Handling and Logging**

Checking whether the system provides meaningful error logs and diagnostic data during recovery.

#### 8. **User Experience Post-Recovery**

Ensuring that users can resume their work seamlessly without additional complexity or confusion.

## When to Perform Recovery Testing ?

Recovery testing should be performed at **strategic points in the development and operational lifecycle**, including:

* **Before Production Deployment**\
  To ensure recovery mechanisms are fully functional before the system goes live.
* **After Major Infrastructure Changes**\
  When adding new servers, databases, or failover systems.
* **After Implementing Backup or Disaster Recovery Solutions**\
  To validate that new processes meet RTO and RPO requirements.
* **Periodically During Maintenance Cycles**\
  To confirm ongoing readiness as environments and dependencies evolve.
* **Before High-Risk Releases**\
  Especially when changes could impact fault tolerance or failover behavior.
* **After a Real Incident**\
  To verify fixes and improvements after an actual failure scenario.
* **For Compliance and Audit Requirements**\
  When regulations mandate proof of disaster recovery capabilities.

## Recovery Testing Tools and Frameworks

Recovery testing often requires a combination of **failure simulation tools, backup validation utilities, monitoring solutions, and automation frameworks** to effectively test disaster recovery readiness.

#### **Failure Simulation and Chaos Engineering**

* **Chaos Monkey (Netflix Simian Army)** – Randomly terminates system components to test recovery from failures.
* **Gremlin** – Controlled fault injection platform to simulate outages, latency spikes, and resource exhaustion.
* **LitmusChaos** – Kubernetes-native chaos testing framework for cloud-native systems.

#### **Backup and Restore Validation**

* **Veeam Backup & Replication** – Enterprise-grade backup and recovery solution.
* **Bacula** – Open-source backup tool for automated backup and restore verification.
* **AWS Backup** – Cloud-native backup orchestration and recovery testing for AWS workloads.

#### **Database Recovery Testing**

* **Oracle RMAN** – Oracle database recovery management tool.
* **pgBackRest** – Backup and restore solution for PostgreSQL with reliability testing features.
* **mysqldump + Restore Scripts** – Simple MySQL recovery verification.

#### **Monitoring and Alerting**

* **Prometheus + Grafana** – Monitor recovery time, system health, and failure events.
* **ELK Stack** – Aggregate and analyze logs to detect recovery issues.
* **Datadog / New Relic** – Full-stack monitoring for post-recovery performance analysis.

#### **Automation and Test Orchestration**

* **Ansible / Terraform** – Automate failover and recovery environment setup.
* **Jenkins** – Schedule and automate recovery test suites in CI/CD pipelines.

## Best Practices

#### 1. **Test Realistic Failure Scenarios**

Simulate the types of failures most likely to occur, including hardware crashes, network outages, and software defects.

#### 2. **Measure RTO and RPO Compliance**

Track recovery time and data loss metrics to ensure they meet business requirements.

#### 3. **Test Both Planned and Unplanned Outages**

Include maintenance-mode recovery and unexpected crash recovery in the test plan.

#### 4. **Validate Data Integrity**

Confirm that all restored data is complete, consistent, and uncorrupted.

#### 5. **Test Under Load**

Perform recovery tests while the system is under realistic or peak load conditions.

#### 6. **Automate Recovery Tests**

Integrate recovery checks into regular testing pipelines for ongoing validation.

#### 7. **Test Redundancy and Failover Mechanisms**

Verify that backup systems take over seamlessly without user intervention.

#### 8. **Document Recovery Procedures**

Ensure recovery steps are well-documented for operations teams.

#### 9. **Re-Test After Infrastructure or Application Changes**

Any change that could impact fault tolerance should trigger a new recovery test cycle.

#### 10. **Review and Improve After Real Incidents**

Use post-incident analysis to refine recovery strategies and tooling.
