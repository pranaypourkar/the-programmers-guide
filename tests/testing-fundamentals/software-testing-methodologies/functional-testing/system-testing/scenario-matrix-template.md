# Scenario Matrix Template

## About

A **Scenario Matrix Template** for **System Testing** organizes and tracks test cases that validate the **entire software system as a whole**.\
Unlike unit or integration testing, system testing verifies the **complete, integrated application** against **functional and non-functional requirements** in an environment that closely resembles production.

This matrix ensures:

* All **end-to-end workflows** are covered
* Both **functional correctness** and **non-functional attributes** (performance, security, usability, etc.) are validated
* Dependencies such as databases, external services, APIs, and middleware are tested together
* Realistic user scenarios are executed to detect issues that could occur in live usage

System testing scenarios often cover **business workflows, user role permissions, data integrity, error handling, and compliance checks**.
