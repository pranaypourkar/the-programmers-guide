# Integration Testing

## About

**Integration Testing** is the process of verifying that individual software components or modules work together as intended when combined.\
While unit tests check isolated parts of the system, integration tests validate the correctness of their interactionsâ€”ensuring data is passed correctly, APIs are invoked as expected, and modules integrate without defects.

Integration testing may be **narrow in scope** (e.g., testing two closely related classes) or **broad in scope** (e.g., testing multiple services and a database). It plays a crucial role in detecting interface mismatches, incorrect assumptions, and errors caused by changes in dependent modules.

**Gray Box Testing**

Gray Box Testing is a method where the tester has partial knowledge of the internal workings of the software. This approach combines elements of both Black Box and White Box testing. The tester might have access to some architectural documents, database diagrams, or code.

## Purpose of Integration Testing

* Ensure that modules developed by different team members or teams interact correctly.
* Validate data flow between components, services, and external systems.
* Detect interface errors, contract violations, and mismatched assumptions.
* Verify integration with third-party APIs, libraries, or external systems.
* Reduce the risk of system-level failures caused by faulty module interactions.

## Characteristics of Good Integration Tests

* **Covers Real Interactions**: Uses actual module connections where possible, avoiding excessive mocking.
* **Focused Scope**: Targets the interaction boundaries, not the internal logic of individual components.
* **Representative Environment**: Runs in an environment close to production in terms of configuration and dependencies.
* **Detects Interface Failures**: Specifically checks for data format mismatches, missing fields, and incorrect request/response handling.
* **Stable and Repeatable**: Provides consistent results under the same conditions.

## When to Perform Integration Testing ?

Integration testing is typically performed:

* After unit tests pass for individual modules.
* When new modules or APIs are added to the system.
* During continuous integration, after code is merged into a shared branch.
* After upgrading or replacing dependencies, libraries, or external services.
* Before system testing, to ensure that foundational integrations are working.

## Best Practices

* **Start Small, Then Expand**: Begin with component-level integration tests, then scale to system-level integrations.
* **Use Test Data Strategically**: Include normal, boundary, and invalid data to validate robustness.
* **Isolate External Failures**: When testing integrations with unstable or unavailable third-party systems, use stubs or contract testing.
* **Automate Where Possible**: Integrate with CI pipelines to catch integration issues early.
* **Log Clearly**: Ensure tests produce detailed logs for easier debugging of cross-module issues.
* **Version Control API Contracts**: Keep schemas and interface contracts versioned to detect breaking changes early.
* **Consider Testcontainers**: For database or message broker testing, use Testcontainers or in-memory equivalents for realistic testing.

## &#x20;Integration Testing Tools and Frameworks

Choice of tools depends on language, architecture, and integration type. Common examples include:

* **Java / Spring Boot**
  * **JUnit 5** + **Spring Boot Test** for wiring up application context.
  * **Mockito** for mocking selective dependencies while testing real integrations.
  * **Testcontainers** for spinning up real databases, message brokers, or external services in isolation.
  * **WireMock** for simulating HTTP APIs.
  * **REST Assured** for REST API testing.
* **API Contract Testing**
  * **Pact** for consumer-driven contract testing between services.
* **Message-Driven Systems**
  * Embedded brokers (ActiveMQ Artemis, Kafka) or Testcontainers for realistic message flow testing.
* **Front-end + Back-end**
  * Cypress, Playwright, or Selenium (if integration involves UI).
