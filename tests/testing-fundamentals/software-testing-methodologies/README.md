# Software Testing Methodologies

## Description

Software Testing Methodologies refer to the structured approaches and practices used to validate that software applications meet specified requirements and are free from defects. These methodologies encompass a range of techniques, strategies, and procedures designed to ensure the quality, performance, and reliability of software products. They guide the testing process from planning and design to execution and reporting.

### Types of Software Testing Methodologies

Software Testing Methodologies can be broadly categorized into two main types:

**1. Functional Testing Methodologies**

Functional testing focuses on verifying that the software operates according to its specifications and correctly performs its intended functions.

* **Black Box Testing**: Testing without knowledge of the internal workings of the application. Testers focus on input and output.
* **White Box Testing**: Testing with knowledge of the internal logic of the application. It involves testing internal structures or workings.
* **Gray Box Testing**: Combines both black-box and white-box testing techniques. Testers have partial knowledge of the internal workings.

**2. Non-Functional Testing Methodologies**

Non-functional testing focuses on evaluating the performance, usability, reliability, and other non-functional aspects of the software.

* **Performance Testing**: Assesses the speed, responsiveness, and stability of the software under various conditions.
* **Usability Testing**: Evaluates how user-friendly and intuitive the software is.
* **Security Testing**: Identifies vulnerabilities and ensures the software protects data and maintains integrity.
* **Compatibility Testing**: Ensures the software works across different environments, such as browsers, devices, and operating systems.
* **Reliability Testing**: Checks the software's ability to perform consistently over time.
* **Localization Testing**: Verifies the software's adaptability to different languages and regions.
